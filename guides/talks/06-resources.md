If you are looking for additional resources to help you prepare your talk proposal or refine your submission, here are some useful links and references:

[:color[**Proposal Jam 2025**]{blue}](https://youtu.be/wfo-uVotPpg): An online session hosted in March, 2025\. This space was created to brainstorm ideas and craft compelling submissions for the conference. The session brought together 70+ attendees from various cities. Participants joined in to explore potential ways to shape their submissions, and gained clarity on conference themes and formats.

[:color[**Past years lineup**]{blue}](https://vizchitra.com/2025/videos): Explore talks, panels, and sessions from the 2025 edition of VizChitra. The archive showcases a mix of keynote speakers, hands-on case studies, and experimental formats across data journalism, product analytics, public data, and creative dataviz. Browsing the lineup is a good way to understand the depth, style, and diversity of sessions that have been selected in the past, and can help you calibrate the scope, tone, and ambition of your own proposal.

[:color[**Join the community**]{blue}](https://vizchitra.com/community): Be part of an active WhatsApp community of 1800+ people interested in data visualizations. The group is where the community shares conference updates, calls for collaboration, job and project opportunities, experiments, and occasional feedback requests on works-in-progress. It is also a space to ask questions, find collaborators, and stay connected with practitioners across cities even beyond the conference.
