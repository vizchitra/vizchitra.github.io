Getting ready for the Conference Day

:color[Plan for Location]{blue} – Reconfirm the location of the conference, plan for your travel and aim to be there early. Bangalore traffic can be very difficult.

:color[Arrive for Tech Check]{blue} – Your Editorial PoC will communicate the time for the technical check for your session - to test the laptop and mic setup. This is mandatory, not optional. Please reach well before your scheduled tech check. Ideally come at the start & attend the whole conference day!

:color[Boot-up your Laptop]{blue} – You will present using your own laptop. There are no spare laptop for presentation provided by the conference. Set it up & test it out at least during the break before your planned session

:color[Keep 16\:9 Aspect Ratio]{blue} – Set the aspect ratio for your presentation & laptop to match the projection on the stage. This is typically 16\:9 to render well for the widescreen presentation used.

:color[Backup for Internet]{blue} – You must not rely on conference internet to present demos, code snippets and videos. Internet can and will get spotty with that many people in the audience. Plan to pre-record your demos or add appropriate screenshots in the presentation.

:color[Carry your Connectors]{blue} – You need to bring your own correct HDMI/VGA cables for connecting from your Laptop to the AV system in the Audi & Halls.
Bring a Clicker – Need to control your slides away from the laptop. Well, clickers are not provided by the conference. Speakers have to bring their own!
