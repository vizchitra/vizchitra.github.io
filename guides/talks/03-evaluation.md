## Evaluation Guidelines

Your proposal will be reviewed by the Editorial Team. Here's what we look for:

**What makes a strong VizChitra session?**

The most successful sessions tend to:

- Start from real, lived challenges or questions
- Make the process visible, not just the polished final chart
- Offer concrete, reusable insights or tools
- Create room for reflection, conversation, or play

We value authenticity and practical takeaways over polish. Show us your journey, not just your destination.
