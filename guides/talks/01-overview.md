## Proposal Guidelines

Use these prompts as a mini-outline while drafting your submission.

1. **Who is the audience for your session?** — Think about their backgrounds, roles, and questions. Are they students, early-career practitioners, domain experts, or cross-disciplinary collaborators?

2. **What problem or question are you centering?** — Describe the pain point, curiosity, or gap you want to address. This helps participants understand why your session matters.

3. **What is the scope of your session?** — Outline the main ideas, themes, or steps you plan to cover. It is okay if your work is still evolving – give us a clear sense of direction.

4. **What will participants take away?** — Share the practical outcomes: skills, mental models, checklists, workflows, or new ways of seeing a familiar problem.

5. **Which format best supports your aims?** — Consider whether your idea works best as a talk, group discussion, or hands-on workshop.

## Evaluation Guidelines

Your proposal will be reviewed by the Editorial Team. Here's what we look for:

**What makes a strong VizChitra session?**

The most successful sessions tend to:

- Start from real, lived challenges or questions
- Make the process visible, not just the polished final chart
- Offer concrete, reusable insights or tools
- Create room for reflection, conversation, or play

We value authenticity and practical takeaways over polish. Show us your journey, not just your destination.

## Preparation Guidelines

Once your talk is accepted, here's how to prepare:

**Your Editorial PoC** — Each speaker has a main Point of Contact (PoC) from the Editorial Team assigned to them, to help them before, during & after their talk session. Please reach out to them for any questions about the process.

**Get Started Now** — Please start preparing for your talk as soon as you have received the confirmation. Don't leave it for the last moment. The more iterations you end up doing on your talk, the better it will be both for the audience and for you.

**Share Working Draft** — Share the working draft with your Editorial PoC as soon as possible. This ensures the talk content aligns with the proposal you submitted and gives us an opportunity to provide guidance early in the talk creation process.

**Attend Review Sessions** — The Editorial PoC will schedule up to two review sessions with external reviewers to help you prepare for your talk. Please make the time to do these sessions.

- Reviewer One, from a similar domain as yours, will focus on providing feedback on the content and flow for the talk
- Reviewer Two, someone with prior public speaking experience, will focus on providing feedback on style & delivery
