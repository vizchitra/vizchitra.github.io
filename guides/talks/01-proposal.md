Use these prompts as a mini-outline while drafting your submission.

1. **Who is the audience for your session?** — Think about their backgrounds, roles, and questions. Are they students, early-career practitioners, domain experts, or cross-disciplinary collaborators?

2. **What problem or question are you centering?** — Describe the pain point, curiosity, or gap you want to address. This helps participants understand why your session matters.

3. **What is the scope of your session?** — Outline the main ideas, themes, or steps you plan to cover. It is okay if your work is still evolving – give us a clear sense of direction.

4. **What will participants take away?** — Share the practical outcomes: skills, mental models, checklists, workflows, or new ways of seeing a familiar problem.

5. **Which format best supports your aims?** — Consider whether your idea works best as a talk, group discussion, or hands-on workshop.

| **Demo**        | Exemplar driven with multiple demos           |
| **Visual**      | Show, not tell — anchor through visuals       |
| **Process**     | Illustrate process and share war stories      |
| **Narrative**   | Singular arc with a main visual showcase      |

Remember: Aim to speak with stories and present with impact.
