# Workshop Proposal

Use these prompts as a mini-outline while drafting your workshop proposal.

1. **Who are you imagining in the room?** – Who would this workshop be most helpful for? What do they care about, struggle with, or want to get better at?
2. **What’s the thing you’re excited to share?** – This could be a problem you’ve wrestled with, a question you keep coming back to, or a gap you wish someone had helped you with earlier.
3. **What journey will the workshop take people on?** – Sketch the rough shape of the session — the ideas, moments, or steps you’d like to move through. It’s okay if it’s still evolving.
4. **What do you hope people walk away with?** – Think in terms of practical value or perspective shifts: a new way of thinking, something they can try next week, or language for a problem they already have.
5. **How do you imagine the session unfolding?** – Will it be hands-on, discussion-driven, reflective, or a mix? Describe the format that feels natural for this idea.

### Pick a workshop

Sometimes it helps to think about the type of workshop you want to teach. Here are some common formats we see at VizChitra:

| Zero to One       | Teach how to get started an great example.       |
| Tool Deep Dive    | Teach how to use a data visualization tool well. |
| X to 10X workshop | Teach how to master a niche viz capability.      |

### Designing a great workshop

Teaching a workshop session is helping the participants gradually climb the “Ladder of Abstraction”. Be thoughtful in designing your workshop so that it has all the four key stages of ladder:

1. Assimilating & Conceptualizing — _What is this, and how does it fit with what I already know?_
2. Experimenting & Practicing — _Let me try this myself and see what actually happens._
3. Planning for Application — _Where will I use this next, and what’s my first step?_
4. Learning by Reflections — _What worked, what didn’t, and what will I do differently?_
