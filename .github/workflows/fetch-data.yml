        # WHY this action:
        # • Detects file changes
        # • Commits them
        # • Creates or updates a PR
        # • Outputs PR number if one exists
        #
        # IMPORTANT:
        # If no files changed → no PR → later steps must be conditional

      # ⏳ GitHub sometimes marks a PR "not mergeable" for a few seconds after creation.
      # Without this delay, auto-merge can fail intermittently.

            --admin

        # WHY --admin:
        # • Bypasses approval requirements for automated PRs
        # • Merges immediately (doesn't wait for checks)
        # • Requires workflow to run with admin permissions
        #
        # WHY --squash:
        # • Keeps history clean for generated commits
