				"In this hands-on workshop, you'll go from zero to a live data visualization using only natural-language prompts (plus a dash of copy-&-paste). Turn raw data into a compelling narrative—all by chatting with an LLM. No coding knowledge is required (but it’ll help a lot.) No API key required but you’re welcome to bring your own. This will be an end-to-end workflow that designers, developers and data enthusiasts can follow verbatim.",

				'What power structures can be dismantled when the power to speak the language of data becomes accessible to everyone? The Daily Data Project is a workshop designed to engage in a discourse on creating data visualizations using everyday household objects. The workshop introduces a toolkit developed as a part of my graduation project, which acts as a vertical to simplify the visualization process. While the toolkit offers structure and encourages participants to experiment and explore freely, the key purpose of the workshop is to develop visualizations on a particular city’s transport system and services. And for a city like Bangalore, the results would be quite interesting to observe.',

				"Ever wondered what the unique sound of your name looks like? In this hands-on workshop, we’ll embark on an exciting journey to capture your “sonic signature” and translate it into a striking visual landscape. We’ll begin by generating the audio waveform of your name using text-to-speech. We'll then delve into audio analysis, extracting meaningful data from the audio output. This data will form the foundation for our visualization. Next, we’ll explore data visualization, learning how to sculpt this processed audio data into a compelling visual representation inspired by the iconic and stark aesthetic of Joy Division’s album artwork. By the end of this exercise, participants will have the opportunity to plot their visual representation, and take home as a physical artwork.",

While there are many mapping softwares available, the one we will be focussing on is Quantum GIS or QGIS. Why QGIS? Because it's open source and a one-stop-solution for everything spatial.",

Building a city's pollution storyline using visual aids, without missing the scientific rigor.",
