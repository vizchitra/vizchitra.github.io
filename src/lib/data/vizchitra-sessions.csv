1,Rukmini S,"Founder and Director, Data For India",The Data Is Here.,But Whom Is It Serving?,keynote,Opening keynote,"The last ten years have seen a dramatic improvement in access to Indian data, allowing journalists to tell richer stories, analysts to get a better sense of Indian realities, and designers to have much more to work with. Improvements are now happening faster than ever, more so with the adoption of machine learning and large language models. How do we use this moment to do better than we had imagined? By asking the important questions. We talk too little about what goes into the making of data, who has access to information and who doesn?t, and who is able to work with it or make sense of it and not, and how we are using this data and to what end. In this talk, I hope to share some data that grounds my insights, and encourage us to engage with these questions.",27 June | 09:30 - 10:00 am,"Bangalore International Centre, Bengaluru",2,5,3,4,5,Narrating insights,https://hasgeek.com/VizChitra/2025/sub/the-data-is-here-but-whom-is-it-serving-T8JzpVLF6VruwBTE6rP8zR,,-20,15,
2,S ANAND,LLM Psychologist @ Straive and CEO @ Gramener,Data Design By Dialogue.,Visualising Data with LLMs,keynote,Closing keynote,"In this live session, we'll walk through how to go from a bare prompt to a polished, shareable chart?entirely by conversing with an LLM. Along the way, you'll see real demos, such as this Web Features explorer, Elimination Game, LLM mental math evaluation, etc. and learn to: ? Use ChatGPT instead of Jupyter Notebooks, Figma, or D3 as the canvas for data storytelling ? Engineer prompts that generate valid data analyses and visualizations ? Iteratively refine axis scales, colors and annotations without writing a single line of code ? Automate interpretation: ask the model for captions, tooltips, and data insights ? Spotlight future trends: what generative data art looks like in six months",27 June | 04:15 - 04:45 pm,"Bangalore International Centre, Bengaluru",5,5,5,5,5,Narrating insights,https://hasgeek.com/VizChitra/2025/sub/data-design-by-dialogue-visualizing-data-with-llms-EX3YtVF1mqSqnxY5LAtuRE,0.9,-30,,

14,S ANAND,LLM Psychologist @ Straive CEO @ Gramener,Prompt-to-Plot:,Crafting Visual Stories with LLMs,workshop,,"In this hands-on workshop, you'll go from zero to a live data visualization using only natural-language prompts (plus a dash of copy-&-paste). Turn raw data into a compelling narrative?all by chatting with an LLM. No coding knowledge is required (but it?ll help a lot.) No API key required but you?re welcome to bring your own. This will be an end-to-end workflow that designers, developers and data enthusiasts can follow verbatim.",28 June | 10:00AM - 01:00PM,"Samagata Space, Church St",5,5,5,5,5,Coding visualizations,https://hasgeek.com/VizChitra/2025/sub/prompt-to-plot-crafting-visual-stories-with-llms-NgKP2m1BeYMTJsdY2gcepz,,,,

16,ARUNDATHI RAJAN,"Exhibition Design, National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad",Democratising Data:,Stories using everyday objects,workshop,,"What power structures can be dismantled when the power to speak the language of data becomes accessible to everyone? The Daily Data Project is a workshop designed to engage in a discourse on creating data visualizations using everyday household objects. The workshop introduces a toolkit developed as a part of my graduation project, which acts as a vertical to simplify the visualization process. While the toolkit offers structure and encourages participants to experiment and explore freely, the key purpose of the workshop is to develop visualizations on a particular city?s transport system and services. And for a city like Bangalore, the results would be quite interesting to observe.",28 June | 10:00AM - 01:00PM,"Underline Center, 2nd Floor, Indiranagar",5,5,4,5,5,Designing visualizations,https://hasgeek.com/VizChitra/2025/sub/democratising-data-stories-using-everyday-objects-Hzpvjihbd8BytrnqDhUjyS,1.75,25,85,
17,SAMARTH GULATI,Software Engineer @ Postman,The Sonic Signature:,Plotting Your Name's Audio Landscape,workshop,,"Ever wondered what the unique sound of your name looks like? In this hands-on workshop, we?ll embark on an exciting journey to capture your ?sonic signature? and translate it into a striking visual landscape. We?ll begin by generating the audio waveform of your name using text-to-speech. We'll then delve into audio analysis, extracting meaningful data from the audio output. This data will form the foundation for our visualization. Next, we?ll explore data visualization, learning how to sculpt this processed audio data into a compelling visual representation inspired by the iconic and stark aesthetic of Joy Division?s album artwork. By the end of this exercise, participants will have the opportunity to plot their visual representation, and take home as a physical artwork.",28 June | 02:30PM - 05:30PM,"Underline Center, 2nd Floor, Indiranagar",2,2,5,5,5,Coding visualizations,https://hasgeek.com/VizChitra/2025/sub/the-sonic-signature-plotting-your-names-audio-land-338GFKxc1WGoTnpQywGEMs,,,,
18,PULAHA ROY,"Senior Data Journalist, Centre for Science and Environment",Let's Get Mapping!,(QGIS),workshop,,"Of all the data visualisation forms available, maps have always fascinated me the most - it deals with data that is about us, the space we inhabit, and they just look wow. While there are many mapping softwares available, the one we will be focussing on is Quantum GIS or QGIS. Why QGIS? Because it's open source and a one-stop-solution for everything spatial.",28 June | 10:00AM - 01:00PM,"Underline Center, 3rd Floor, Indiranagar",4,4,5,5,4,Designing visualizations,https://hasgeek.com/VizChitra/2025/sub/lets-get-mapping-with-qgis-tHTXRBChT1y4DtC89dqua,,,,

But sadly now, we don't just feel it deep inside our lungs but also see it with our red, itchy eyes. But there is more than what our irritable eye can see. This session is about learning to see air using data from monitoring stations, modeling results, and satellites. Building a city's pollution storyline using visual aids, without missing the scientific rigor.",28 June | 02:30PM - 05:30PM,"Underline Center, 3rd Floor, Indiranagar",5,5,5,5,5,Narrating insights,https://hasgeek.com/VizChitra/2025/sub/chitra-lekha-narrating-air-pollution-data-AshpXZxTBkjAKpZzAxfjFg,0.95,,,
