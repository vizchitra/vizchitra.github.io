## About These Guides

These guides are designed to support both you and us as we move from first idea to final delivery for your VizChitra session.

They bring together best practices, practical tips, and curated guidelines to help you prepare, refine, and share your work with confidence across the entire journey. Think of this as a working reference you can return to at every stage.

These are living documents. We will continue to update them as questions emerge and insights evolve. If you have suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/vizchitra/vizchitra.github.io.

## Our Five Guides

At VizChitra, each way of participating reflects a distinct approach to engaging with data. Talks center narrative and lived experience. Workshops emphasize learning and skill-building through doing. Dialogues create space for shared inquiry. The Exhibition invites immersive, sensory encounters. Panels bring multiple perspectives into thoughtful tension.

Together, these five approaches reflect how we learn and make meaning — through story, through practice, through conversation, through experience, and through perspectives.
