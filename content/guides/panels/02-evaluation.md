# Evaluation

We are looking for panels that surface diverse perspectives and productive tension.

> “Diversity is the art of thinking independently together.”
> — Malcolm Forbes

**The Collective Journey** in the panel submission we are looking for:

- **Theme:** Frames a shared real-world challenge or industry tension.
- **Stakes:** Clarifies why the topic benefits from multiple viewpoints.
- **Composition:** Brings together meaningfully different voices or roles.
- **Debate:** Encourages constructive disagreement and live interaction.
- **Contrast:** Makes differences in approach and experience explicit and useful.
- **Synthesis:** Draws practical patterns and insights across perspectives.

## Panel Evaluation Rubric

Your submission will be reviewed by our Editorial Team and a group of experienced moderators. We aim to have a **rough consensus** amongst the multiple evaluators for each proposal. The evaluation rubric below is how each one of them will be looking at the proposal.

| Criteria                      | Strong                                                                                    | Maybe                                                              | Weak                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Theme & Stackes**           | Clearly defined challenge with meaningful stakes that benefit from multiple perspectives. | Defined topic but stakes or tension unclear                        | Broad or generic topic with limited depth or urgency.           |
| **Perspective Diversit**y\*\* | Brings together meaningfully different voices, roles, or philosophies.                    | Some variation in background but perspectives may overlap.         | Panelists likely to share similar viewpoints or experiences.    |
| **Constructive Tension**      | Intentionally surfaces disagreement, trade-offs, and contrasting approaches.              | Some differences expected but not explicitly designed into format. | Structured as sequential mini-talks with minimal interaction.   |
| **Moderation Strategy**       | Clear and thoughtful moderation plan ensuring flow, balance, and depth.                   | Basic moderator structure described but limited detail.            | No clear moderation plan; discussion risks imbalance or drift.  |
| **Audience Integration**      | Designed moments for audience input, questions, or live interaction.                      | Q&A included but not meaningfully integrated.                      | Audience remains largely passive throughout session.            |
| **Insight Synthesis**         | Clear plan to distill discussion into patterns, contrasts, and practical takeaways.       | Some expectation of summarisation but not clearly articulated.     | Session likely to end without cohesive insights or conclusions. |
