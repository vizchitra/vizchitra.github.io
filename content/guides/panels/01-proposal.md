# Proposal

Panel sessions are curated conversations that bring together diverse perspectives around a shared challenge, tension, or emerging shift in data visualisation practice.

> The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time.
> — F. Scott Fitzgerald

Think of these as dynamic, moderated explorations — not a sequence of mini-talks. Your role is to design a structured conversation where contrast, disagreement, and nuance generate insight for the audience.

A strong panel does not aim for agreement. It surfaces patterns, trade-offs, and competing philosophies in a way that helps the audience think more clearly.

## Writing Your Proposal

A strong proposal shows you can frame a compelling theme _and_ architect a productive multi-voice exchange. Focus on clarity of stakes and intentional moderation. Why does this topic benefit from multiple perspectives, and how will you ensure the discussion remains dynamic and coherent?

Use these as prompts for your outline:

- **What central theme or tension anchors the panel?** — Frame this as a real-world challenge, trade-off, or emerging shift that benefits from multiple viewpoints.
- **Why does this topic require a panel (and not a talk)?** — Explain what contrasting experiences, philosophies, or roles make this conversation richer when explored collectively.
- **Who should be on the panel?** — Describe the kinds of roles, contexts, or viewpoints that would create meaningful diversity. Consider industry vs academia, designers vs engineers, practitioners vs leaders, etc.
- **What productive tensions might emerge?** — Identify areas of disagreement, differing incentives, constraints, or philosophies that could surface.
- **How will the panel be moderated?** — Outline the structure. Example: framing question → contrasting viewpoints → moderated tension → audience questions → synthesis. Show how you’ll avoid sequential mini-presentations.
- **How will the audience be involved?** — Will there be live polling, structured Q&A, curated audience prompts, or integrated questions throughout?
- **What should participants walk away with?** — Could be clarified trade-offs, decision frameworks, contrasting approaches, emerging patterns, or sharper questions.

## Panel Session Formats

Choose a format that creates contrast and interaction rather than isolated speeches.

| Format                  | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structured Tension**  | Moderator surfaces contrasting positions early and revisits them throughout |
| **Role-Based Contrast** | Each panelist represents a distinct role or constraint                      |
| **Case Comparison**     | Panelists respond to the same real-world scenario from different lenses     |
| **Rapid Response**      | Short timed answers to focused prompts to maintain energy                   |
| **Audience-Driven**     | Majority of questions sourced live from participants                        |
| **Trade-Off Mapping**   | Panel collectively maps competing priorities or decisions                   |

## What Makes a Strong Panel

- A sharply framed theme with clear stakes
- Meaningful diversity of perspectives
- Intentional moderation design
- Constructive disagreement, not polite agreement
- Integrated audience participation
- Clear synthesis before closing

**Think of your role as a moderator of tension, not a host of speakers.**
