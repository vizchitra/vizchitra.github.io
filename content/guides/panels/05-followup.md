# Followup

The actions doe not stop after you finish moderating the Panel. Here is what you should do after your session.

> “Insight comes from disagreement as well as agreement.”
> — adapted from Karl Popper

**Get & Share feedback** – Many people will share feedback for the panel as comments, sketch notes or even annotated photos. Collate and use these anecdotes to understand how the audience connected with the panel. Combine it with the formal feedback to get the overall sense of the session.

**Summarize the Panel** – Post a summary of the panel and key takeaways for everyone, beyond the immediate audience. A good example is the “No one Starts in DataViz, So how do we end up here” which was the event summary for the Viz Biz panel. You can also include the formal and informal feedback you have received for the panel in the summary.

**Share the Video** – Share and promote the video of the panel with the wider community, to continue the conversation beyond just the panel session.

**Honorarium & Reimbursement** – Please complete the process for receiving your honorarium & reimbursement.
