# Overview

Panels at VizChitra are focused, moderated discussions built around an engaging and relevant topic.

> “We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.”
> — Anaïs Nin

## Intent

At VizChitra, panels are a **Collective Journey** — moderated conversations where multiple perspectives surface tensions, trade-offs, and shared insight.

This guide helps you move from proposing a strong theme, through coordination and review, to delivering a discussion that feels dynamic, balanced, and cohesive.

## Format of Panels

A moderated conversation featuring 3–4 domain experts who share experiences, lessons learned, and challenges through structured questions and guided discussion.

_Duration_: 30 - 60 minutes
