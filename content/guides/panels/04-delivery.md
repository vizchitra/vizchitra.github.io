# Delivery

The moderators and panel members interplay plays a crucial role in the impact for the Panel.

> “Strong opinions, loosely held.”
> — Paul Saffo

## Tips for the Moderator

The moderators sets the scene, directs the flow of questions and keeps the energy going in the panel. Some things to keep in mind for the moderator are:

- Set the context for the panel topic for the audience
- Talk briefly about the panelists (to save time), especially in shorter panel of 30 min only.
- Ask the questions, managing flow and duration of the overall panel.
- Moderate the discussion as needed - skipping topics, following up and keeping it conversational.
- Encourage audience to ask questions, but keep them short and ideally directed towards a single panelist.
- Summarize the panel insights, at the end & highlight key takeaways for the audience.

## Tips for Panel Members

The panelist contributes by sharing their insight and stories on the topic, keeping the flow of questions in mind and building on each others insight.

- Be mindful of time. Try to keep your answers short and to the point.
- Engage with moderator question and build on stories, insights & questions that emerge through out the discussion.
- Be respectful of other panelist opinions, even if it differs dramatically from your own.
- Keep the conversation fun and engaging
