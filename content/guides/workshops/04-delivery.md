# Delivery

Getting ready for the Workshop Day to the deliver the session.

> The only source of knowledge is experience.
> — Albert Einstein

**Plan for Venue** – Reconfirm the time & venue for the workshop (they are likely to be different from the main conference venue), plan for your travel and aim to be there early. Bangalore traffic can be very difficult.

**Arrive before Time**: Aim to be at the workshop location at least an one hour before your session. It will help you orient better with the space.

**Boot-up your Laptop** – You will be using your own laptop. There are no spare laptop for presentation provided by the conference. Set it up & test it out at least during the break before your planned session

**Keep 16\:9 Aspect Ratio** – Set the aspect ratio for your presentation & laptop to match the projection on the stage. This is typically 16\:9 to render well for the widescreen presentation used.

**Backup for Internet** – You must not rely on internet to be present for demos, code snippets and videos. Internet can get spotty even with just 30 peoples. Have a back up plan if the internet fails.

**Carry your Connectors** – You need to bring your own correct HDMI/VGA cables for connecting from your Laptop to the AV system in the Audi & Halls.
