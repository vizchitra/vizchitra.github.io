# Proposal

Workshop sessions are hands-on learning spaces designed to move participants from understanding to application.

> “Learning is experience. Everything else is just information.” — Albert Einstein

Think of these as structured learning journeys — not extended talks. Your role is to design an experience where participants actively engage, experiment, and leave with something they can use.

A strong workshop doesn’t just transfer knowledge. It builds capability.

## Writing Your Proposal

A strong proposal shows you can anchor the session in real practice and guide participants through a meaningful learning journey. Focus on clarity of outcomes and thoughtful facilitation design.

Use these prompts to shape your outline:

- **Who are you imagining in the room?** – Who would this workshop be most helpful for? What skill level are they at? What do they care about, struggle with, or want to get better at? What motivates them?
- **What’s the thing you’re excited to share?** – This could be a problem you’ve wrestled with, a question you keep coming back to, or a gap you wish someone had helped you with earlier.
- **What real-world challenge anchors this session?** – What recurring tension, capability gap, or unanswered question in data visualisation practice is this workshop grounded in?
- **What journey will the workshop take participants on?** — Sketch the rough shape of the session — the ideas, moments, or steps you’ll move through. How will understanding build? When will participants practice? Where will reflection happen?
- **What will participants be able to do afterward?** – Think in terms of practical value or perspective shifts: a new way of thinking, something they can try next week, or language for a problem they already have.
- **How will participants actively engage?** — Will the session be hands-on, discussion-driven, reflective, or a mix? Will they build something, analyse examples, work in small groups, or critique each other’s work? Describe the format that feels natural for this idea.
- **What will participants leave with?** — What tangible output or shift should participants walk away with? A draft visualisation? A checklist? A clearer decision framework?
- **How will you handle constraints and trade-offs?** — Acknowledge limitations, assumptions, or context-specific considerations and explain the real-world complexity.

## Workshop Types

Sometimes it helps to think about the type of workshop you want to teach. Choose a format that supports progressive learning and active participation, but also where you are in your own practices. Here are some common formats we see at VizChitra:

| Type                   | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exemplar Driven**    | Deconstruct and rebuild a strong example step-by-step.          |
| **Zero to One**        | Guide participants from blank canvas to functional output.      |
| **Tool Deep Dive**     | Explore a visualisation tool in depth through guided exercises. |
| **X to 10X**           | Strengthen a specific niche skill through progressive practice. |
| **Critique & Iterate** | Analyse and improve real-world viz work collaboratively.        |

### Designing a great workshop

Teaching a workshop session is helping the participants gradually climb the “Ladder of Abstraction”. Be thoughtful in designing your workshop so that it has all the four key stages of ladder:

1. **Framing for Clarity** — What is this really about, and how does it connect to what I already know or believe?
2. **Doing for Learning** — What do I notice when I try this myself? What surprises me?
3. **Planning for Application** — Where might this show up in my own work, and what small step could I take next?
4. **Reflecting for Insight** — What worked, what didn’t, and what might I approach differently moving forward?

The best workshops balance structure and experimentation — giving participants both confidence and clarity.

**Think of your role as a learning guide, not a lecturer.**
