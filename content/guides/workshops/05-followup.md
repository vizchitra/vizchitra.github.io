Getting ready for the Workshop Day

Delivering the Workshop

Plan for Venue – Reconfirm the time & venue for the workshop (there are two of them - Samagata Space & Underline Center), plan for your travel and aim to be there early. Bangalore traffic can be very difficult.

Arrive before Time: Aim to be at the workshop location at least an one hour before your session. It will help you orient better with the space.

Boot-up your Laptop – You will be using your own laptop. There are no spare laptop for presentation provided by the conference. Set it up & test it out at least during the break before your planned session

Keep 16:9 Aspect Ratio – Set the aspect ratio for your presentation & laptop to match the projection on the stage. This is typically 16:9 to render well for the widescreen presentation used.

Backup for Internet – You must not rely on internet to be present for demos, code snippets and videos. Internet can get spotty even with just 30 peoples. Have a back up plan if the internet fails.

Carry your Connectors – You need to bring your own correct HDMI/VGA cables for connecting from your Laptop to the AV system in the Audi & Halls.
