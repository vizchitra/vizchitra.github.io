# Follow Up

The action does not stop after you finish facilitating the Workshop. Here is what you should do after your session.

> The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.

- **Share your Experience** – The Instructor should share their experience of teaching the workshop on social media and Friends of VizChitra Group. This helps others understand what was covered in the session and continues the conversation beyond the session.
- **Send a Post-Workshop Update** – Instructor working with Editorial PoC should send an update about the materials shared and further references, latest one week after the workshop - along with the group photo.
- **Feedback for the Workshop** – The Editorial PoC will tabulate and share the feedback form responses with the Instructor. This helps you to see what worked and what can be improved in the session in the future.
- **Honorarium & Reimbursement** – Please complete the process for receiving your honorarium & reimbursement.
