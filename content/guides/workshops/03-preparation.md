# Preparation & Reviews

Each accepted workshop goes through a structured preparation & review process to help the facilitator get ready for the final delivery.

## Tell us & participants what you need & expect

**Teaching Assistant** – If the Instructor needs the VizChitra community to arrange for a Teaching Assistant (TA), they must inform 2 weeks before the workshop date. The instructor can bring their own Teaching Assistant.

**Share Handouts & Class Material** – If the instructor wants to give away handouts (designed by the Instructor) for their workshop, they have to share a print-ready file 2 weeks before the workshop.

**Inform about Instructional Aids** – Instructor has to communicate 2 weeks before the workshop if they need any teaching aids - white board, flip chart etc.
Send Preparation Update Three Days before – The instructor sends an update - at least three days before the workshop, to “project participants only” about the prior preparation and reading material before the workshop.

## Promote, Share & Send Updates

**Promote your Workshop** – Workshops are a separate ticketed events & learners sign up for them independently. Instructors should promote their workshop on social media channels, and among communities that they are part of and in their organisation.

**Send Logistical Update One Day before** – The editorial POC sends an update one day before the workshop about the logistical information for the workshop

**Create Workshop Feedback Form** – The Editorial PoC also prepares the workshop feedback form with inputs from the Instructor, at least 2 weeks before the workshop.

## Editorial Review Process

**Your Editorial PoC** – Each instructor has a Point of Contact (PoC) from the Editorial Team assigned to them, to help them before, during & after their session. Please reach out to them for any questions about the process.

**Improve your Session Page** – Instructors improve their workshop page - make it well structured, clear & visual for the audience. See here an example of a workshop page. The page should especially clarify the following:

- What is the overview objective for the workshop?
- What is the session wise agenda, including start, break & end times?
- What are the key takeaways for participants?
- What are the prerequisites to attend the workshop?
- What prior preparation and setup is needed by participants
- Who is the audience for the workshop?
- Why are you the right person to teach it?

**Use the Review Sessions** – The Editorial PoC will schedule up to two review sessions with external reviewers to help you prepare for your workshop. Please make the time to do these sessions.

- Reviewer One, from a similar domain as yours, will focus on providing feedback on the content for the workshop. This ensure the workshop mets the objective of the audience attending the conference

- Reviewer Two, someone with prior workshop / teaching experience, will focus on providing feedback on instructional design
