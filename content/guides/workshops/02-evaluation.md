# Evaluation

We look for workshops that offer hands-on experiences and actionable depth, ensuring participants walk away with learnings they can use immediately.

> An ounce of practice is worth more than ton of preaching.
> — Mahatma Gandhi

**The Practice Journey** in the workshop submission we are looking for:

- **Reality:** Anchors the session in real-world, lived challenges or pressing questions rather than abstract theories.
- **Outcomes:** States what participants should be able to do or apply afterward.
- **Navigation:** Explains how you will guide participants through the working steps.
- **Interactivity:** Centres active doing and experimentation over passive listening.
- **Application:** Produces usable tools, methods, or artefacts during the session.
- **Tradeoffs:** Acknowledge limits and choices honestly, not just ideal paths.

## Workshop Evaluation Rubric

Your proposal will be evaluated by our Editorial Team and a panel of experienced workshop facilitators. We aim to have a **rough consensus** amongst the multiple evaluators for each proposal. The evaluation rubric below is how each one of them will be looking at the proposal.

| Criteria                    | Strong                                                                             | Maybe                                                      | Weak                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reality Anchoring**       | Clearly rooted in real-world challenges or practitioner needs.                     | Some real-world grounding, but abstract in parts.          | Largely theoretical or disconnected from practice.                   |
| **Learning Outcomes**       | States clear, measurable skills or capabilities participants will gain.            | Outcomes stated but broad or unclear.                      | No clear outcomes defined.                                           |
| **Facilitation Navigation** | Thoughtful step-by-step flow explaining how participants move through the session. | General flow described but lacks clarity or pacing detail. | No clear structure; unclear how session will unfold.                 |
| **Interactivity Design**    | Centres active doing, experimentation, and hands-on work.                          | Includes interactive elements but not core to session.     | Primarily presentation-based with minimal doing.                     |
| **Practical Application**   | Produces usable artefacts, tools, or techniques during the workshop.               | Application implied but not fully embedded.                | No clear practical output or usable learning.                        |
| **Tradeoffs & Depth**       | Acknowledges constraints, limitations, and design choices honestly.                | Mentions complexity but without depth.                     | Presents idealised approach without acknowledging real-world limits. |
