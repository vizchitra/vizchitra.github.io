# Overview

Conducting a workshop at VizChitra is an opportunity to teach, share, and create hands-on learning experiences with the visualization community.

We will help you move from defining clear learning outcomes in your proposal, through the review process, to designing activities and facilitating a session that feels engaging, thoughtful, and genuinely useful.

## Format of Workshop

**Hands-on Workshop** – An immersive learning experience designed to encourage creativity, practical application, and skill development. Participants gain hands-on experience while receiving direct guidance from facilitators.

_Duration_: Half-day (3 hours total, with 20 mins tea break in between)
