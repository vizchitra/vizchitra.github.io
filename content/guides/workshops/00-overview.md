# Overview

Conducting a workshop at VizChitra is an opportunity to design and facilitate hands-on learning experiences for the visualisation community.

> “Tell me and I forget. Show me and I remember. Involve me and I understand.”

## Intent

At VizChitra, workshops are a **Practice Journey** — hands-on spaces where understanding deepens through doing, experimenting, and reflecting.

This guide helps you move from defining clear learning outcomes in your proposal, through review and preparation, to designing and facilitating a session that feels engaging, rigourous, and genuinely useful.

## Format of Workshop

**Hands-on Workshop** – An immersive learning experience designed to foster creativity, practical application, and skill development. Participants gain hands-on experience while receiving structured guidance from facilitators.

_Duration_: Half-day (3 hours total, with 20 mins tea break in between)
