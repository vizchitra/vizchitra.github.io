# Proposal

**How to shape your proposal**

These prompts are here to support you as you draft your submission.

1. **What’s the idea in one line?** – What are you trying to show, question, or make people notice?
2. **What counts as “data” in your project?** – Data can be numbers, but also photos, interviews, notes, drawings, archives, maps, WhatsApp responses, sound recordings, or sensor readings. Tell us what you’ll use, and why.
3. **Where will the data come from? (your method)** – How will you collect it (or how have you collected it)? For instance: field visits, conversations, workshops, observation diaries, scraping public sources, simple sensors.
4. **How will you turn it into an artwork / experience?** – Will it be a print, poster series, screen-based piece, installation, projection, sound work, interactive station, or something else? Reference images help, but are optional.
5. **Why does it matter here?** – How does your project connect to ecology and everyday life—heat, water, air, floods, food systems, urban change, or more-than-human worlds?
6. **What do you need to make it happen?** – List essentials like power, table / wall space, projector, speakers, internet, sensors, laptop, etc.
7. **Can you finish it in time?** –Tell us if it’s already made, in progress, or a new idea, and outline a simple, realistic timeline.

Strong proposals clearly connect the data, the way it’s gathered, and the form of visualization. They also showcase how the work helps audiences notice relationships between environments, infrastructures, and lived experience in a fresh way.
