# Evaluation

We look for exhibition projects that transform data into meaningful encounters — ensuring audiences don’t just see information, but experience relationships in tangible ways.

> Everything is connected to everything else.
> — Barry Commoner

**The Immersive Journey** in the exhibition submission we are looking for:

- **Clarity:** Clearly connects data source, method, and visual or spatial form.
- **Grounding:** Anchors the work in a specific ecological, infrastructural, or lived context.
- **Method:** Explains how the data is gathered, generated, or interpreted — thoughtfully and ethically.
- **Form:** Translates data into an experiential medium that invites attention, interaction, or reflection.
- **Insight:** Reveals relationships, tensions, or patterns that help audiences notice something new.
- **Feasibility:** Demonstrates the capability to execute the work within space, time, and technical constraints.

## Exhibition Evaluation Rubric

Exhibition proposals are reviewed through a curatorial process. Outcomes fall into three categories:

**Strong:** Can be accepted, with curatorial suggestions. The project aligns strongly with the exhibition vision and may require refinement through dialogue.

- We communicate with the proposer and share curatorial suggestions
- The proposer prepares visual mockups, sketches, or technical diagrams
- A curatorial review is conducted
- Production needs, technical requirements, and timeline are discussed
- The project is confirmed and moves to exhibition planning and communication

**Maybe:** Might be accepted, after vital revisions. The concept shows promise but requires clarification or strengthening.

- We communicate specific concerns or gaps
- Clarifications may be requested around experiential design, data methodology, technical feasibility, or timeline
- The proposer revises and resubmits with additional detail
- A second review is conducted
- If concerns are addressed, the project moves to acceptance
- If not, it may be declined with constructive feedback

**Weak:** Rejected. The proposal does not align sufficiently with the exhibition vision at this time.

- We send thoughtful feedback outlining strengths and gaps
- We clarify what did not align with exhibition vision
- Where appropriate, we encourage reapplication in future editions
- We aim to maintain a relationship with the artist

| Criteria                          | Strong                                                                                                                                             | Maybe                                                                                                                           | Weak                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proposal Clarity**              | Clearly articulates idea, data source, method, and experiential form. Connections are explicit. Timeline and technical requirements are realistic. | Concept is interesting but connections between data, method, and form need clarification. Some feasibility details are missing. | Description is vague or incomplete. It is unclear how data becomes experience or whether the project is feasible. |
| **Experiential Quality**          | Creates a distinctive spatial, sensory, or interactive encounter. Form is thoughtfully matched to content.                                         | Experiential dimension has potential but feels underdeveloped or conventional.                                                  | Reads as a static display with minimal consideration of audience encounter.                                       |
| **Ecological Relevance**          | Makes a compelling connection to ecology, climate, or lived environmental experience. Reveals meaningful relationships.                            | Ecological connection exists but feels broad or underdeveloped.                                                                 | Ecological framing is superficial, unclear, or forced.                                                            |
| **Data Approach**                 | Data source is specific and ethically grounded. Method is appropriate and clearly described. Expands what counts as data in thoughtful ways.       | Data source identified but methodology or ethics require clarification. Timeline for collection may be tight.                   | Data source is vague or problematic. No clear method. Ethical considerations not addressed.                       |
| **Data Analysis & Visualisation** | Strong synthesis between aesthetic expression and analytical rigour. Visualisation reveals non-obvious insight or deepens narrative meaning.       | Conceptually sound but lacks novelty or depth in either visualisation or analysis.                                              | Weak analytical grounding or aesthetic coherence. Insight is unclear or unconvincing.                             |
| **Feasibility & Capability**      | Demonstrates clear ability to execute within timeline and technical constraints.                                                                   | Shows potential but execution or timeline raises questions.                                                                     | Insufficient evidence of capability. Timeline unrealistic or technically unfeasible.                              |
