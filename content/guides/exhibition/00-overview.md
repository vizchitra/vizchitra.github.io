# Overview

The Exhibition at VizChitra offers a space for immersive, data-driven visualisation projects that invite exploration, interaction, and reflection.

> The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.
> — Marcel Proust

Exhibits move beyond presentation into experience. They create opportunities for the community to encounter data in tangible ways — through touch, sound, movement, space, and participation. Whether sculptural, screen-based, printed, sensory, or participatory, your project becomes a shared site of inquiry.

We will support you from shaping a compelling concept and proposal, through review and preparation, to installing and presenting a work that engages audiences meaningfully.

## Format of Exhibitions

A curated showcase of data-driven works presented as installations, interactive stations, projections, prints, sound pieces, or object-based forms. These projects encourage viewers to slow down, explore, question, and converse — individually and collectively.

_Duration:_ Displayed in an exclusive gallery space during the conference day (with optional live demonstrations or scheduled walkthroughs)
