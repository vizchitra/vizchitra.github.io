# Evaluation

We are looking for a meaningful story with a clear "so what?" for our audience.

> The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon.
> — Brandon Sanderson

**The Narrative Journey** in the talk submission we are looking for:

- **Context:** Grounds the talk in real, lived challenges or burning questions.
- **Relevance:** Makes clear why this story matters for today’s data visualisation practice.
- **Process:** Makes the journey visible — including sketches, failed drafts, and pivots, not just the polished final chart.
- **Engagement:** Creates space for reflection and follow-up thinking beyond the talk.
- **Utility:** Offers concrete, reusable insights, frameworks, or checklists the audience can apply.
- **Authenticity:** Shows practical takeaways over polish — the journey, not just the destination.

## Talk Evaluation Rubric

Your proposal will be reviewed by our Editorial Team and external reviewers with extensive speaking experience. We aim to have a **rough consensus** amongst the multiple evaluators for each proposal. The evaluation rubric below is how each of them will be looking at the proposal.

| Criteria                      | Strong                                                                                                                          | Maybe                                                             | Weak                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context & Relevance**       | Clearly grounded in lived challenges and makes a compelling case for why this story matters now in data visualisation practice. | Some context provided, but urgency or relevance could be clearer. | Lacks grounding in real practice or unclear why it matters.            |
| **Narrative Journey**         | Transparently outlines the journey — including process, pivots, failures, or evolution of thinking.                             | Mentions process but focuses mainly on outcomes.                  | Focuses only on final results; no visible journey.                     |
| **Idea Quality**              | Core idea is thoughtful, coherent, and aligned with the spirit of the conference.                                               | Idea has merit but lacks clarity or strong alignment.             | Idea is unfocused, derivative, or misaligned.                          |
| **Engagement Design**         | Proposal shows intentional design for reflection, curiosity, or continued thinking beyond the talk.                             | Some engagement implied but not clearly structured.               | Purely presentation-focused; no consideration for audience engagement. |
| **Utility of Takeaways**      | Clear, practical insights, frameworks, or lessons the audience can apply.                                                       | Takeaways present but vague or underdeveloped.                    | Takeaways unclear, generic, or impractical.                            |
| **Authenticity & Reflection** | Demonstrates honesty, reflection, and learning — not just polished achievement.                                                 | Some reflection evident but limited depth.                        | Reads as self-promotion or highlight reel without reflection.          |
