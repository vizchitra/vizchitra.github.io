# Evaluation

Here is what they are looking for in a sessions:

- Starts from real, lived challenges or questions
- Makes the process visible, not just the polished final chart
- Offers concrete, reusable insights or tools
- Create sroom for reflection, conversation, or play

We value authenticity and practical takeaways over polish. Show us your journey, not just your destination.
