# Preparation

Every accepted talk goes through a focused preparation and review process.

> It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove.
> – Antoine de Saint Exupéry

This phase helps speakers sharpen their core message, structure their narrative, and ensure clarity of insight. The goal is not just to inform, but to move an audience with a well-crafted idea delivered with intention.

## Prepare for your Talk

This process involves atleast two stages of feedback and iteration to ensure your talk is polished, thoughtful and engaging for the audience. Reviews are conducted by members of the VizChitra community – editorial team, past speakers as well as other experts, who provide constructive feedback on both content and delivery.

**Your Editorial PoC** — Each speaker has a main Point of Contact (PoC) from the Editorial Team assigned to them, to help them before, during & after their talk session. Please reach out to them for any questions about the process.

**Get Started Now** — Please start preparing for your talk as soon as you have received the confirmation. Don't leave it for the last moment. The more iterations you end up doing on your talk, the better it will be both for the audience and for you.

**Share Working Draft** — Share the working draft with your Editorial PoC as soon as possible. This ensures the talk content aligns with the proposal you submitted and gives us an opportunity to provide guidance early in the talk creation process.

**Attend Review Sessions** — The Editorial PoC will schedule up to two review sessions with external reviewers to help you prepare for your talk. Please make the time to do these sessions.

- Reviewer One, from a similar domain as yours, will focus on providing feedback on the content and flow for the talk
- Reviewer Two, someone with prior public speaking experience, will focus on providing feedback on style & delivery

> A speaker should approach his preparation not by what he wants to say, but by what he wants to learn.
> ― Todd Stocker
