Getting ready for the Conference Day

> Storytelling reveals meaning without committing the error of defining it.
> ― Hannah Arendt

**Plan for Location** – Reconfirm the location of the conference, plan for your travel and aim to be there early. Bangalore traffic can be very difficult.

**Arrive for Tech Check** – Your Editorial PoC will communicate the time for the technical check for your session - to test the laptop and mic setup. This is mandatory, not optional. Please reach well before your scheduled tech check. Ideally come at the start & attend the whole conference day!

**Boot-up your Laptop** – You will present using your own laptop. There are no spare laptop for presentation provided by the conference. Set it up & test it out at least during the break before your planned session

**Keep 16\:9 Aspect Ratio** – Set the aspect ratio for your presentation & laptop to match the projection on the stage. This is typically 16\:9 to render well for the widescreen presentation used.

**Backup for Internet** – You must not rely on conference internet to present demos, code snippets and videos. Internet can and will get spotty with that many people in the audience. Plan to pre-record your demos or add appropriate screenshots in the presentation.

**Carry your Connectors** – You need to bring your own correct HDMI/VGA cables for connecting from your Laptop to the AV system in the Audi & Halls.
Bring a Clicker – Need to control your slides away from the laptop. Well, clickers are not provided by the conference. Speakers have to bring their own!

> To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from ‘What information do I need to convey?’ to ‘What questions do I want my audience to ask?’”
