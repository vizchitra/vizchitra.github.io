# Follow Up

The actions does not stop after you deliver the talk on the stage. Here is what you should after your session.

**Interact with Audience** – The fun & interaction does not just end with you finishing your talk and stepping off the stage. The audience interaction and feedback can continue during the conference and asynchronous, using social media and “Friends of VizChitra” groups.

**Upload your Presentation** – After your talk is finished at the conference, add the link to your final slide deck in the proposal page. This is required because participants may want to refer to your slides when going over your video.

**Choose a Licence** – Your slides should preferably be made public under an appropriate license. Head over to https://creativecommons.org/choose/ for guidance in choosing a license for your talk. Do add a slide at the end of your presentation mentioning that your slides are released under a license.

**Share the Video** – Share and promote the video of the talk with the wider community, to continue the conversation beyond just the conference session.

**Honorarium & Reimbursement** – Please complete the process for receiving your honorarium & reimbursement.
