# Preparation

Every accepted dialogue session goes through a preparation and review process to help shape the framing questions and conversational flow.

> Seek first to understand, then to be understood.
> — Stephen Covey

This phase helps facilitators clarify intent, shape framing questions, and anticipate diverse perspectives. The goal is to create space for thoughtful exchange rather than presentation.

## Prepare for your Dialogue

**Prepare Concept Note** – Preparation for a “Dialogues” starts with a concept note for the session. The intent here is to have the right set of prompts to facilitate the conversation. Dialogues can be impromptu, but the invited ones for facilitation would be helped by having a concept note.

**Facilitate, not Present** – There is no presentation or a single person acting as a presenter for the sesion. The aim of the session is to facilitate the conversation with other interested participants on the particular topic.

**Understand the Space** – Unlike a talk or a panel, the space for a Dialogue is more informal and the seating arrangement ensures the participants can all see each other. The arrangement would be more circular, rather than facing a singular direction, like towards the stage.

**Chatham House Rule** – Dialogues at VizChitra will follow Chatham House Rule (To Be Confirmed) - “Anyone who comes to a meeting is free to use information from the discussion, but is not allowed to reveal who made any particular comment.” This rule is designed to increase openness of discussion, even on topics that may be considered controversial

**No Video Recording** – Following from the Chatham House Rule, there will be no video recording done for the Dialogues

**Note Taking** – We encourage at least one person to take notes during the session. These notes can be shared with the Editorial PoC after the session for documentation purposes.

**Graphic Facilitation** – You can combine art, drawing, graphic design and facilitation techniques to create real time visual representations of ongoing conversations. If you go this route, please discuss with the Editorial PoC and let us know at least two weeks in advance of what materials you will require.
