# Proposal

Dialogue sessions — previously called _Birds of a Feather (BoF)_ — are participant-driven conversations where people with shared interests in data visualization explore questions together.

> The quality of our thinking is largely determined by the quality of our questions.
> — Edward de Bono

Think of these as facilitated conversations, not presentations or panels. Your role it to create a space for peers to compare experiences and develop collective insight — not deliver a mini-talk or disguised workshop.

## Writing Your Proposal

A strong proposal shows you can frame a meaningful conversation _and_ facilitate it effectively. Focus on clarity of intent and quality of questions. Why is this conversation worth having, and how will you help participants engage productively?

Use these as prompts for your outline:

- **Who is this dialogue for?** — Describe the participants who would benefit most. Are they practitioners, researchers, designers, managers, students, or mixed roles? What shared interest connects them?
- **What central question or theme will anchor the discussion?** — Frame this as an open, generative prompt — not a lecture topic. Strong Dialogue sessions start with a question participants can respond to from experience.
- **Why is this conversation needed now?** — Explain the tension, uncertainty, emerging practice, or unresolved challenge that makes this worth discussing together.
- **What perspectives or experiences should be represented?** — Suggest the kinds of voices, contexts, or case experiences that would enrich the room.
- **How will you structure the conversation?** — Sketch your facilitation plan. Example: opening prompt → small group breakouts → full group synthesis → shared takeaways. Show you'll guide the discussion, not dominate it.
- **What should participants walk away with?** – Could be shared patterns, clarified questions, peer connections, contrasting approaches, or a list of next experiments.
- **What preparation (if any) will participants need?** — Should participants bring examples, questions, tools, or prior experience?

## Dialogue Session Formats

Choose a structure that supports shared participation rather than one-way delivery.

| Format                  | Description                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open Question**       | Poses a core question and guide rotating responses       |
| **Experience Exchange** | Participants share short real-world cases and lessons    |
| **Problem Clinic**      | Volunteers present challenges; group offers perspectives |
| **Debate & Contrast**   | Structured comparison of differing approaches            |
| **Pattern Mining**      | Group extracts common patterns across experiences        |
| **Future Mapping**      | Participants explore scenarios and emerging directions   |

## What Makes a Strong Dialogue Session

- A clear framing question
- Inclusive participation design
- Light but intentional facilitation
- Space for disagreement and nuance
- Visible synthesis at the end
- Focus on peer learning over expert delivery

**Think of your role as a conversation architect, not a presenter.**
