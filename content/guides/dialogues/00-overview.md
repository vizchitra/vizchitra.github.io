# Overview

Interactive discussions and Q&A sessions at VizChitra provide opportunities for deep question driven engagement with visualization topics.

> A dialogue is very important. It is a form of communication in which question and answer continues till a question is left without an answer. – Jiddu Krishnamurti

## Intent

At VizChitra, dialogues are a **Shared Journey** — participant-driven spaces where questions are explored collectively and meaning emerges through conversation.

This guide helps you move from framing a compelling question, through review and preparation, to facilitating a dialogue that feels open, inclusive, and genuinely collaborative.

## Format of Dialogues

An unconference-style, community-driven gathering that brings together participants with shared interests. These sessions foster peer learning and exchange through facilitated discussions on common questions, challenges, and perspectives.

_Duration_: 45 - 60 minutes
