# Overview

Interactive discussions and Q&A sessions at VizChitra provide opportunities for deep question driven engagement with visualization topics.

> A dialogue is very important. It is a form of communication in which question and answer continues till a question is left without an answer. – Jiddu Krishnamurti

We will support you from framing a compelling idea and proposal, through evaluation and preparation, to hosting a conversation that feels open, inclusive, and meaningful.

## Format of Dialogues

An unconference-style, community-driven gathering that brings together participants with shared interests. These sessions foster peer learning and exchange through facilitated discussions on common questions, challenges, and perspectives.

_Duration_: 45 - 60 minutes

This guide helps you move from a strong framing idea and proposal through review, preparation, and facilitation — so you can host a conversation that feels open, thoughtful, and genuinely collaborative.
