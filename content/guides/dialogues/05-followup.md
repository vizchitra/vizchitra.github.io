# Followup

The actions does not stop after you finish facilitating the Dialogue. Here is what you should after your session.

**Get & Share feedback** – Many people will share feedback for the BoF as comments or sketch notes. Collate and use these anecdotes to understand how the audience connected with the Dialogue. Combine it with the formal feedback to get the overall sense of the session.

**Summarize the Dialogue** – Post a summary of the BoF and key takeaways for everyone, beyond the immediate audience. Use wiki-style docs or graphic notes to do this, either during or just after the session. Remember - the BoFs session rules do not allow attributing takeaways to a specific participant.

**Share Resources** – If there were any resources, links, references or reading materials mentioned during the BoF, please collate them and share it with the Editorial PoC. They can help share it with the wider community.

**Honorarium & Reimbursement** – Please complete the process for receiving your honorarium & reimbursement.
