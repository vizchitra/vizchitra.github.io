<Slanted tag="h2" color="orange" textContent="DATA, OTHERWISE" />

VizChitra 2026 invites submissions for **\*Data, Otherwise**,\* an exhibition of contemporary data visualization work focused on climate and ecological change, especially work connected to India and South Asia.

**We’re looking for projects that stretch what data visualization can be**: not only charts and screens, but experiences that people can walk through, listen to, touch, or sit with.

## Themes

The exhibition is organized around three interconnected themes. You can use them as starting points, not strict categories:

<FullBleed class="px-4 md:px-8">
<Grid minWidth="20rem" maxColumns={3} gap={6}>

<Card variant="bordered" color="pink" title="Visualizations for Community">

### **More-than-human data**

Data made with, through, or about non-human worlds like flora, fauna, rivers, soil, microbes, weather systems and more, where sensing and meaning extend beyond people and instruments.

### Living with climate change

Climate as lived experience, for example heat as exhaustion, rain as anxiety, or smoke as grief, where feelings, memory, and the body become part of what data can hold and communicate.

</Card>

### Adaptation and resilience

Everyday examples of coping and changing for people, communities, and environments as they adjust, resist, or rebuild. We’re interested in what gets counted as “resilience,” and what stays out of view.
