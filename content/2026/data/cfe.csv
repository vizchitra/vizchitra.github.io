Despite being an escalating problem to public heath in cities across the world, tools for tackling air pollution are often complex, data-heavy, and designed for multiple purposes, making them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. UEinfo seeks to address the challenges by  focusing on four key objectives:
1. Sharing knowledge on air pollution
2. Providing science based air quality analysis
3. Promoting advocacy and raising awareness on air quality management and
4. Building partnerships among local, national, and international air-heads

This common question assumes that we are just victims of air pollution. But a lot of activities from our daily routine are responsible for the polluted air we breathe and these often go under the radar. Our exhibits aim to evoke that feeling of shared responsibility in visitors, in a playful way.

1. Our exhibits will interact with the visitor to nudge their perceptions about air pollution towards reality. From the simple AQI that we read in the news to the knowledge on sources of air pollution, there are various, often funny, perceptions. We will bring them out leaving the visitor saying, “Ah! I didn’t know this!”

2. Our installations will present air pollution as a solvable problem, but with certain costs that everyone should be willing to pay. They will provoke questions like, “Am I ready to subsidise the wood stove of a poor household as that one stove can emit as much as 250 cars?” We also plan digital and hands-on board games that’d equip visitors to answer such questions.

3. We can engage visitors for up to 30 minutes. On an average, a visitor would spend about 10-15 minutes with our exhibits. 

At the heart, air pollution is not just a scientific-technological problem. It is a political problem and a conscious community plays a huge role in solving it. The first step towards building that community is to make individuals feel that they are part of a community. We hope to strike that chord of community in the visitors.","1. The locations of CPCB’s air pollution monitors on a city’s map, for a couple of cities where we expect maximum visitor interest. This is public data.

2. Data on sources of air pollution for the chosen cities. This is scientific data that is obtained from both literature and our modelling efforts.

3. Data on emissions management: This is the information on ways to reduce/skip emission generation activities and seek better air quality. This is scientific data obtained from literature.

4. We’d also do some playful surveys from the visitors collecting their perceptions on their pollution footprints and sources of air pollution.
"," Screen-based and participatory chart-based.
1. A chart that plots CPCB’s monitor locations with a 2km radius buffer on Bengaluru’s base map. Visitors would pin their homes on the map. This chart communicates the unrepresentative nature of the city’s monitoring network, and the gaps in AQI that we read in the news everyday.

2. A chart that surveys visitor’s perceptions on sources of air pollution for a few cities – Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai. We’d present the reality later in the evening.

3. The data on emissions management will be presented in the form of a board game we designed. It’ll nudge visitors to think about reducing pollution either by reducing or changing the emission generation activity. 

4. We designed a digital quiz of the Jeopardy style (American TV Show). We plan to play it during the session breaks for ~15 minutes. We’ll also bring zines we made that has the required material.

This tangible data installation explores the water footprint of everyday meals by representing the total freshwater consumed across the food supply chain, from cultivation and irrigation to processing and distribution. Aligned with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), the work highlights how water use embedded in food remains largely invisible to consumers.

Experience:
Visitors encounter a table-based installation resembling a dining setup. Common meals are placed on individual placemats designed to resemble puddles of water. Each placemat has ripples that encodes the meal’s water footprint in proportional scale, creating the illusion of a real puddle beneath the plate, something present yet typically unnoticed. A concise legend explains how the data is translated. Visitors move around the table, compare meals, and observe variations in scale. The experience is contemplative and comparative, lasting approximately 3 to 5 minutes per visitor.

Why Data is Central:
The installation is generated directly from verified comparative water footprint data measured in litres per unit of food. Scale, proportion, spacing, and material quantity are determined by numerical values. Data does not decorate the work; it constructs it. The visual and spatial relationships emerge from measured differences within the dataset.

Core Question: What changes when the hidden water embedded in our meals becomes materially visible?

Context:
Agriculture accounts for the largest share of global freshwater withdrawals, yet this resource intensity rarely informs daily food choices. In water-stressed and rapidly urbanising regions, understanding embedded water becomes increasingly urgent. The project connects individual consumption to broader food systems, ecological stress, and sustainability infrastructures.

Why it Fits Data, Otherwise:
By translating environmental statistics into embodied spatial form, the work treats data as material, revealing the intimate link between everyday life and planetary resource systems.","The data has been sourced from credible secondary sources on food water footprints:

1. WaterCalculator.org
2. Our World in Data
3. 4TU ResearchData repository
4. Water Footprint Network (waterfootprint.org)

These sources compile life-cycle and agricultural water use data, typically measured in litres per kilogram or per metric ton of food.","1. How does the size of the puddle change across meals?
2. Which ingredients form the thickest ripples?
3. What everyday foods carry unexpectedly high water footprints?
4. How do personal dietary choices connect to larger agricultural systems?
5. Can awareness of water footprints influence consumption patterns?
6. How do global food systems impact water security in vulnerable regions?
7. What does sustainability look like when measured through resource intensity rather than price or convenience?",https://storage.tally.so/private/ShreyaDan-Exhibition-Proposal.pdf?id=7pKjG2&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjdwS2pHMiIsImZvcm1JZCI6ImxiZXlndiIsImlhdCI6MTc3MDUzMjI5MX0.i7F2UjAGqFBadUQ_h2Y39Y563HeOsGkO-z9wMVH-O50&signature=4bccf7e2588fee9707184e48a6fd3f38c30a2069bd5a9c1ee8bbb6cbb3d22e66,"Spatial Requirement

1. Six Tables ( 4 ft × 3 ft) 
2. Height: Standard table height (75–90 cm)
3. Clear circulation space: At least 3 ft (90 cm) around the table for movement and viewing

The installation relies on comparative scale. Visitors need to step back to perceive proportional differences and move closer to read the legend and inspect material quantities. Adequate circulation ensures multiple viewers can engage simultaneously without crowding.","This is an existing work which is a part of my Tangible Data Viz module at National Institute of Design, Bengaluru.",I consent to VizChitra publishing my submission and the review of my application.,TRUE,,Keep,Under Review

This installation serves as a communal mirror, contrasting nationwide survey data with scientific truths. Each display pairs Perception—the stories we tell ourselves—against Reality—the data of our changing environment. As visitors interact with live installations, they see their personal reflections integrated into the broader community’s voice. The work highlights that climate change is not just a physical crisis, but a shared psychological experience, aiming to close the gap between awareness and understanding.","The installation draws its 'Perception' data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication’s report, Climate Change in the Indian Mind, utilizing both quantitative statistics and qualitative quotations to map public sentiment. These subjective insights are juxtaposed with 'Reality'—empirical facts and environmental metrics sourced directly from official reports published by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).","The installation uses physical materials and color theory to distinguish between climate reality and public perception. Central to the work are semi-transparent layers: solid, 3D visualizations—such as bar charts crafted from reclaimed wood—represent empirical facts, while ""filters"" of distorted glass or mesh represent the lens of perception. This layering forces viewers to look through their own biases to find the underlying truth.

To bridge the gap between viewer and data, the work incorporates live interactive stations. A mechanical balance scale allows visitors to weigh their personal anxieties against statistical probability; by placing physical weights, they can see if their fears are ""overweight"" compared to reality. Additionally, a modular collection wall invites participants to contribute objects or notes to specific compartments, documenting the community’s evolving lived reality.

The exhibition highlights how polluted rivers affect our food systems, and how interventions such as river linking can disrupt critical wildlife corridors and the ecologically fragile Western Ghats, among other concerns.

At the heart of the exhibition is a story map that traces the journey of a raindrop from the street or rooftop where it falls in Bengaluru, through lakes and drains, into the largely unacknowledged river systems of the city. It also explores the reasons for our disconnect from these systems and the urgent need to reconnect.

This work sits at the intersection of community and ecology. Water is central to our lives, yet our freshwater ecosystems are in deep crisis. To respond meaningfully, we must first understand these systems, then reconnect with them, and finally act. Before we restore a river in the landscape, we must restore it in people’s hearts. When a city begins to care for its river, restoration ceases to be a project and becomes a culture.

At Paani Earth Foundation, we have been building evidence to support this shift by developing detailed river maps that compile data on stressors, government monitoring stations, sewage treatment infrastructure, hazardous waste facilities, and more. This work is fundamentally data-driven i.e it synthesizes datasets that exist in silos into a coherent, basin-level understanding of river health and governance gaps.

The exhibition format is a deliberate extension of our work that is data intensive. It allows complex evidence to be translated into visual, spatial, and narrative formats that non-technical audiences can engage with.

In this sense, the initiative is data-led at its core, using the exhibition as the medium to communicate the evidence we have gathered in an interesting format. 
","We have developed map-based infographics using GIS that bring together our field observations, water and sediment analysis, and government data. We have also compiled extensive information on our website, which formed part of the foundation for the Waterscapes of Bengaluru. In addition, we are continuing to build narratives emerging from our monthly ‘By the River’ gatherings and other ongoing work to initiate citizen science initiatives. You can learn about our by the river gatherings here - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/madhuri-mandava-1385a9231_each-of-us-could-have-been-somewhere-else-activity-7393218916694564864-Y8a9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADnuM3wB5avrWQewrFlHuzmW7txMtsCYtJM","Through print, sound, projections, and participatory formats, we want people to pause and reflect on their disconnect from rivers. This disconnect often results in public disengagement when destructive projects are proposed, even when they threaten critical wildlife habitats and endangered species such as the Mahseer. Rebuilding this connection is essential if we are to care, question, and act.

We have already designed a set of panels that can be adapted for this purpose, and we are keen to enhance them to make the experience more interactive for the Vizchitra exhibition",https://storage.tally.so/private/Sample_Panels.pdf?id=0DxAGN&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjBEeEFHTiIsImZvcm1JZCI6ImxiZXlndiIsImlhdCI6MTc3MDc4Njc2N30.KgEBJICTy4hFvjMTitCH-jhzf3-Z14jL36pan74y8aQ&signature=ee4b146d85306368c263cbcb679564a016d6b1f7a66aff0ef1de742f958dfdbb,"We will require basic infrastructure such as power supply, internet connectivity, audio support, screens, and appropriate lighting.

This project visualises my family tree through language, mapping how English, Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, and Kannada circulate across three generations of my maternal and paternal family. Instead of a linear hierarchy, the work unfolds as a dense web, reflecting how identity is formed through overlapping cultural and linguistic exchanges.

At first glance, viewers encounter a complex network of names arranged across generations. As they look closer, a visual system begins to reveal itself: one typeface represents one side of the family, font weights indicate personality traits such as talkative or reserved. The central data layer maps which language I speak with each family member, transforming everyday communication into a structured yet intimate dataset.

The work is rooted in qualitative, lived data - memories, relationships, comfort levels, and conversational habits alongside basic generational hierarchy. Visualisation becomes the method through which this intangible data is organised and made legible. Rather than illustrating a family tree, the piece encodes relational dynamics, allowing viewers to trace patterns and discover how language mediates connection.

Situated within the context of a multilingual family, the project speaks to adaptation as an everyday act. Switching languages, negotiating identity, and bridging cultural nuances become quiet forms of resilience. By mapping these invisible negotiations, the work questions what counts as resilience and what remains unrecorded within family systems.","The project uses primarily qualitative data in the form of text which is subjective and experiential. The data comes entirely from my point of view. It is drawn from lived experience. It comes from memories of conversations, patterns of language use, comfort levels, and the emotional dynamics I associate with each family member. Rather than surveys or formal interviews, the work is based on reflective self-documentation and personal observation accumulated over time.

Although it functions as data, it is also a story. The visualisation translates these personal narratives into a structured system, where subjective experiences are encoded and made legible without losing their emotional context.","The data becomes visible as a large-format printed visualisation that functions as both a map and a field of exploration. Organised across three generations, the work uses typography, spatial relationships, and visual encoding to translate relational and linguistic data into a legible system. Typeface distinctions, font weights, and proximity act as cues, allowing viewers to slowly decode the structure. What first appears as a dense web gradually reveals patterns of language use, personality, and emotional closeness through attentive looking.

The work raises questions about how language shapes intimacy and belonging. What languages do I speak with different family members, and why? Is closeness proportional to fluency, or does it operate beyond language? Which side of my family do I gravitate toward? Which generation am I most connected to? Ultimately, it invites reflection on how communication constructs identity within families.",https://storage.tally.so/private/Apurva_Data-viz-iterations.pdf?id=ENbDGB&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IkVOYkRHQiIsImZvcm1JZCI6ImxiZXlndiIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTA3NTcwNX0.b5POAal3MdMiRBkHQTSG4v6dIWZKwFyRaYFOhw1i5AA&signature=f0ed32618005224cf92d478379f7854f5897302260c107f547238df5406e6edc,N/A,This is an existing work.
