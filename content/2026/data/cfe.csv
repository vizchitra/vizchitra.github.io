This common question assumes that we are just victims of air pollution. But a lot of activities from our daily routine are responsible for the polluted air we breathe and these often go under the radar. Our exhibits aim to evoke that feeling of shared responsibility in visitors, in a playful way.

1. Our exhibits will interact with the visitor to nudge their perceptions about air pollution towards reality. From the simple AQI that we read in the news to the knowledge on sources of air pollution, there are various, often funny, perceptions. We will bring them out leaving the visitor saying, “Ah! I didn’t know this!”

2. Our installations will present air pollution as a solvable problem, but with certain costs that everyone should be willing to pay. They will provoke questions like, “Am I ready to subsidise the wood stove of a poor household as that one stove can emit as much as 250 cars?” We also plan digital and hands-on board games that’d equip visitors to answer such questions.

3. We can engage visitors for up to 30 minutes. On an average, a visitor would spend about 10-15 minutes with our exhibits. 

At the heart, air pollution is not just a scientific-technological problem. It is a political problem and a conscious community plays a huge role in solving it. The first step towards building that community is to make individuals feel that they are part of a community. We hope to strike that chord of community in the visitors.","1. The locations of CPCB’s air pollution monitors on a city’s map, for a couple of cities where we expect maximum visitor interest. This is public data.

2. Data on sources of air pollution for the chosen cities. This is scientific data that is obtained from both literature and our modelling efforts.

3. Data on emissions management: This is the information on ways to reduce/skip emission generation activities and seek better air quality. This is scientific data obtained from literature.

4. We’d also do some playful surveys from the visitors collecting their perceptions on their pollution footprints and sources of air pollution.

1. A chart that plots CPCB’s monitor locations with a 2km radius buffer on Bengaluru’s base map. Visitors would pin their homes on the map. This chart communicates the unrepresentative nature of the city’s monitoring network, and the gaps in AQI that we read in the news everyday.

2. A chart that surveys visitor’s perceptions on sources of air pollution for a few cities – Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai. We’d present the reality later in the evening.

3. The data on emissions management will be presented in the form of a board game we designed. It’ll nudge visitors to think about reducing pollution either by reducing or changing the emission generation activity. 

4. We designed a digital quiz of the Jeopardy style (American TV Show). We plan to play it during the session breaks for ~15 minutes. We’ll also bring zines we made that has the required material.

This tangible data installation explores the water footprint of everyday meals by representing the total freshwater consumed across the food supply chain, from cultivation and irrigation to processing and distribution. Aligned with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), the work highlights how water use embedded in food remains largely invisible to consumers.

Experience:
Visitors encounter a table-based installation resembling a dining setup. Common meals are placed on individual placemats designed to resemble puddles of water. Each placemat has ripples that encodes the meal’s water footprint in proportional scale, creating the illusion of a real puddle beneath the plate, something present yet typically unnoticed. A concise legend explains how the data is translated. Visitors move around the table, compare meals, and observe variations in scale. The experience is contemplative and comparative, lasting approximately 3 to 5 minutes per visitor.

Why Data is Central:
The installation is generated directly from verified comparative water footprint data measured in litres per unit of food. Scale, proportion, spacing, and material quantity are determined by numerical values. Data does not decorate the work; it constructs it. The visual and spatial relationships emerge from measured differences within the dataset.

Core Question: What changes when the hidden water embedded in our meals becomes materially visible?

Context:
Agriculture accounts for the largest share of global freshwater withdrawals, yet this resource intensity rarely informs daily food choices. In water-stressed and rapidly urbanising regions, understanding embedded water becomes increasingly urgent. The project connects individual consumption to broader food systems, ecological stress, and sustainability infrastructures.

Why it Fits Data, Otherwise:
By translating environmental statistics into embodied spatial form, the work treats data as material, revealing the intimate link between everyday life and planetary resource systems.","The data has been sourced from credible secondary sources on food water footprints:

1. WaterCalculator.org
2. Our World in Data
3. 4TU ResearchData repository
4. Water Footprint Network (waterfootprint.org)

These sources compile life-cycle and agricultural water use data, typically measured in litres per kilogram or per metric ton of food.","1. How does the size of the puddle change across meals?
2. Which ingredients form the thickest ripples?
3. What everyday foods carry unexpectedly high water footprints?
4. How do personal dietary choices connect to larger agricultural systems?
5. Can awareness of water footprints influence consumption patterns?
6. How do global food systems impact water security in vulnerable regions?
7. What does sustainability look like when measured through resource intensity rather than price or convenience?",https://storage.tally.so/private/ShreyaDan-Exhibition-Proposal.pdf?id=7pKjG2&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjdwS2pHMiIsImZvcm1JZCI6ImxiZXlndiIsImlhdCI6MTc3MDUzMjI5MX0.i7F2UjAGqFBadUQ_h2Y39Y563HeOsGkO-z9wMVH-O50&signature=4bccf7e2588fee9707184e48a6fd3f38c30a2069bd5a9c1ee8bbb6cbb3d22e66,"Spatial Requirement

1. Six Tables ( 4 ft × 3 ft) 
2. Height: Standard table height (75–90 cm)
3. Clear circulation space: At least 3 ft (90 cm) around the table for movement and viewing

The installation relies on comparative scale. Visitors need to step back to perceive proportional differences and move closer to read the legend and inspect material quantities. Adequate circulation ensures multiple viewers can engage simultaneously without crowding.","This is an existing work which is a part of my Tangible Data Viz module at National Institute of Design, Bengaluru.",I consent to VizChitra publishing my submission and the review of my application.,TRUE,,Keep,Under Review

This installation serves as a communal mirror, contrasting nationwide survey data with scientific truths. Each display pairs Perception—the stories we tell ourselves—against Reality—the data of our changing environment. As visitors interact with live installations, they see their personal reflections integrated into the broader community’s voice. The work highlights that climate change is not just a physical crisis, but a shared psychological experience, aiming to close the gap between awareness and understanding.","The installation draws its 'Perception' data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication’s report, Climate Change in the Indian Mind, utilizing both quantitative statistics and qualitative quotations to map public sentiment. These subjective insights are juxtaposed with 'Reality'—empirical facts and environmental metrics sourced directly from official reports published by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).","The installation uses physical materials and color theory to distinguish between climate reality and public perception. Central to the work are semi-transparent layers: solid, 3D visualizations—such as bar charts crafted from reclaimed wood—represent empirical facts, while ""filters"" of distorted glass or mesh represent the lens of perception. This layering forces viewers to look through their own biases to find the underlying truth.

To bridge the gap between viewer and data, the work incorporates live interactive stations. A mechanical balance scale allows visitors to weigh their personal anxieties against statistical probability; by placing physical weights, they can see if their fears are ""overweight"" compared to reality.

The exhibition highlights how polluted rivers affect our food systems, and how interventions such as river linking can disrupt critical wildlife corridors and the ecologically fragile Western Ghats, among other concerns.

At the heart of the exhibition is a story map that traces the journey of a raindrop from the street or rooftop where it falls in Bengaluru, through lakes and drains, into the largely unacknowledged river systems of the city. It also explores the reasons for our disconnect from these systems and the urgent need to reconnect.

This work sits at the intersection of community and ecology. Water is central to our lives, yet our freshwater ecosystems are in deep crisis. To respond meaningfully, we must first understand these systems, then reconnect with them, and finally act. Before we restore a river in the landscape, we must restore it in people’s hearts. When a city begins to care for its river, restoration ceases to be a project and becomes a culture.

At Paani Earth Foundation, we have been building evidence to support this shift by developing detailed river maps that compile data on stressors, government monitoring stations, sewage treatment infrastructure, hazardous waste facilities, and more. This work is fundamentally data-driven i.e it synthesizes datasets that exist in silos into a coherent, basin-level understanding of river health and governance gaps.

The exhibition format is a deliberate extension of our work that is data intensive. It allows complex evidence to be translated into visual, spatial, and narrative formats that non-technical audiences can engage with.

In this sense, the initiative is data-led at its core, using the exhibition as the medium to communicate the evidence we have gathered in an interesting format. 
","We have developed map-based infographics using GIS that bring together our field observations, water and sediment analysis, and government data. We have also compiled extensive information on our website, which formed part of the foundation for the Waterscapes of Bengaluru. In addition, we are continuing to build narratives emerging from our monthly ‘By the River’ gatherings and other ongoing work to initiate citizen science initiatives. You can learn about our by the river gatherings here - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/madhuri-mandava-1385a9231_each-of-us-could-have-been-somewhere-else-activity-7393218916694564864-Y8a9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADnuM3wB5avrWQewrFlHuzmW7txMtsCYtJM","Through print, sound, projections, and participatory formats, we want people to pause and reflect on their disconnect from rivers. This disconnect often results in public disengagement when destructive projects are proposed, even when they threaten critical wildlife habitats and endangered species such as the Mahseer.

This project visualises my family tree through language, mapping how English, Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, and Kannada circulate across three generations of my maternal and paternal family. Instead of a linear hierarchy, the work unfolds as a dense web, reflecting how identity is formed through overlapping cultural and linguistic exchanges.

At first glance, viewers encounter a complex network of names arranged across generations. As they look closer, a visual system begins to reveal itself: one typeface represents one side of the family, font weights indicate personality traits such as talkative or reserved. The central data layer maps which language I speak with each family member, transforming everyday communication into a structured yet intimate dataset.

The work is rooted in qualitative, lived data - memories, relationships, comfort levels, and conversational habits alongside basic generational hierarchy. Visualisation becomes the method through which this intangible data is organised and made legible. Rather than illustrating a family tree, the piece encodes relational dynamics, allowing viewers to trace patterns and discover how language mediates connection.

Situated within the context of a multilingual family, the project speaks to adaptation as an everyday act. Switching languages, negotiating identity, and bridging cultural nuances become quiet forms of resilience. By mapping these invisible negotiations, the work questions what counts as resilience and what remains unrecorded within family systems.","The project uses primarily qualitative data in the form of text which is subjective and experiential. The data comes entirely from my point of view. It is drawn from lived experience. It comes from memories of conversations, patterns of language use, comfort levels, and the emotional dynamics I associate with each family member. Rather than surveys or formal interviews, the work is based on reflective self-documentation and personal observation accumulated over time.

Although it functions as data, it is also a story. The visualisation translates these personal narratives into a structured system, where subjective experiences are encoded and made legible without losing their emotional context.","The data becomes visible as a large-format printed visualisation that functions as both a map and a field of exploration. Organised across three generations, the work uses typography, spatial relationships, and visual encoding to translate relational and linguistic data into a legible system. Typeface distinctions, font weights, and proximity act as cues, allowing viewers to slowly decode the structure. What first appears as a dense web gradually reveals patterns of language use, personality, and emotional closeness through attentive looking.

The work raises questions about how language shapes intimacy and belonging. What languages do I speak with different family members, and why? Is closeness proportional to fluency, or does it operate beyond language? Which side of my family do I gravitate toward? Which generation am I most connected to? Ultimately, it invites reflection on how communication constructs identity within families.",https://storage.tally.so/private/Apurva_Data-viz-iterations.pdf?id=ENbDGB&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IkVOYkRHQiIsImZvcm1JZCI6ImxiZXlndiIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTA3NTcwNX0.b5POAal3MdMiRBkHQTSG4v6dIWZKwFyRaYFOhw1i5AA&signature=f0ed32618005224cf92d478379f7854f5897302260c107f547238df5406e6edc,N/A,This is an existing work.

Rooted in the biodiversity crisis, it fits the data; otherwise, it makes the data experiential.","The project uses quantitative biodiversity data: IUCN Red List categories (Least Concern to Critically Endangered), population trends, percentage decline over time, assessment years, and geographic range size. Temporal data determines how quickly and intensely each species fades.

All data comes from the International Union for Conservation of Nature through the IUCN Red List database. Species assessments provide structured numeric indicators and documented status shifts.

The data will be compiled into a dataset that directly drives material transformation in the installation. Opacity, fragmentation, or physical erosion will correspond to actual decline metrics, ensuring that visual disappearance is not metaphorical decoration but a precise translation of documented ecological loss.","The data becomes experiential through a physical installation of 3 pieces similar to light boxes where species forms are printed and layered in translucent material that gradually fades out based on the real decline metrics. Each piece is for a specific time that spans out through a century of 'Past' (1970), 'Present' (2020), and 'Future' (2070). This is not a participatory data visualization; the project leans more towards an installation.
The project, more than raising questions, wants the users to notice that many species that we may or may not be aware of are fading out silently while we make noise for some of the flagship species, like the tiger, and such.

The experience is tactile, spatial, and contemplative, inviting viewers to sense loss rather than simply observe it.
Data is central to the work. Population statistics, species diversity records, and ecological studies are translated into textile structures—density of stitches, repetition, scale, and material erosion. Numbers are not displayed as charts but embodied as material conditions.
The project asks: What happens when the smallest, least-noticed lives begin to vanish? It encourages audiences to reconsider insects not as background organisms but as essential agents in pollination, food systems, soil health, and ecological balance.
The work situates itself within urban and peri-urban ecologies, where insect decline is both visible and ignored. While the dataset may be locally grounded, the narrative resonates globally.
This project aligns with More-than-human data and Living with climate change, transforming ecological data into a sensory, experiential encounter.
","The project draws from insect population studies, biodiversity records, and long-term ecological observations. Sources include published entomological research, archival datasets, and citizen-science platforms such as iNaturalist and Biodiversity of India. In addition, I will seek conversations with entomologists to ground the work in lived scientific insights and contemporary ecological concerns.
Data types include numerical population counts, species diversity indices, temporal comparisons, and visual references. Where possible, localized datasets connected to urban and peri-urban ecosystems will be incorporated.
The data will be curated and interpreted to trace shifts across time—abundance, reduction, and disappearance—forming the conceptual basis for material and spatial translation within the textile installation.
","The data is visualized through a walk-through textile installation. Fabric layers, stitch density, pattern repetition, and material degradation represent shifts in insect populations and diversity.
High-density textures signify ecological abundance, gradually transitioning into sparse, fragmented, and translucent textile surfaces. The visualization is experiential rather than screen-based, allowing visitors to see, touch, and physically navigate data.
The work raises questions about invisibility, ecological interdependence, and how environmental loss can be felt through embodied encounters rather than abstract graphics.

For me, it is the fading chatter of the house sparrow.

As our cities grow louder with the mechanical roar of progress - traffic, construction, and digital white noise; they are simultaneously falling biologically silent. This work explores the ""missing frequency"" in our urban soundscape: the disappearance of a bird that was once the heartbeat of the Indian home.

During my childhood, sparrows were constant - nesting in window grills, claiming courtyards, and blurring the line between the wild and the domestic. Today, spotting one feels like a fleeting miracle - a spark of joy shadowed by a mounting, quiet grief.

This project translates ecological trauma into physical, material expression using acrylic and/ or oil. Rather than digital charts, I am encoding environmental stressors directly into the topography of the canvas:
- Impasto Density: Heavy paint thickness as a direct index of population peaks.
- Knife-Stroke Fragmentation: Violent, directional strokes mapping urban disruption and habitat fracture.
- Color Desaturation: Muted, ""fading"" tones signaling ecosystem stress and loss of vitality over time.
- Layer Erosion: Physically scraped and scarred surfaces representing the loss of traditional nesting sites.
- Spatial Void: Increasing ""white space"" or emptiness across the canvas to map the decline from the 1990s to the present.

By bridging scientific metrics with lived memory, the work asks a haunting question: If the rural heartland also falls silent, where does the memory of the sparrow go?
","The artwork will draw upon a synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data:
1. State of India’s Birds (SoIB) Reports: Long-term population trends and conservation status for the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) across Indian landscapes.
2.  eBird India / Citizen Sparrow Project: Spatial presence-absence mapping and longitudinal citizen-science data from urban and semi-urban centers.
3. National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA): Urban biodiversity frameworks and metrics regarding green-to-grey cover transitions in Indian metros.
4. Urbanization Metrics: Longitudinal studies on built-density changes and landscape fragmentation in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities.
","The data is visualised through a large-format acrylic and/or oil painting using heavy-body mediums and palette knives.

Population peaks translate into dense impasto. Decline becomes thinning layers and scraped surfaces. Urban fragmentation informs directional knife strokes. Gradual chromatic fading reflects ecological stress across decades. Increasing negative space represents biological silence.

A minimal printed “Data Legend” accompanies the work, explaining how specific material gestures correspond to dataset trends. The visualisation is entirely physical - no screens - allowing viewers to experience data through texture, proximity, and embodied perception.

While this phenomenon is well-documented in North America, it remains understudied in the Indian context, despite the rapid rise of reflective glass in modern architecture across urban and rural settings. The exhibit features two reflective glass panes that transform abstract, incomplete mortality statistics into a tangible and reflective experience.

Visitors enter a somber, reflective environment where they stand among scattered fake feathers or outlines of fallen birds. They experience the glass from a bird’s perspective, seeing reflections of the sky or greenery as a ""flight path"" rather than a barrier. In one pane, they see a bird-splatter pattern representing species-wise mortality data; in the second, they see how design solutions reduce these impacts. (Reference attached).

I use citizen science data on species and collision frequency ""splatter"" visualisations. Crucially, the work visualises the ""lack of data,"" the estimated gaps in Indian records, using grey/black shapes to make an invisible ecological issue visible.

The work helps us notice the invisible, lesser-known, and recorded reality of biodiversity loss and rethink how modern architectural choices affect the non-human world. It also addresses gaps in formal datasets and translates abstract mortality statistics into a spatial encounter, especially for a crowd that is engaged in finding solutions through data and storytelling.

To deepen the dialogue, an optional live demonstration or talk can be held with an ecologist or an architect to discuss how data and design can address this biodiversity loss.","Numbers & species data: Collision counts and species identification sourced from an iNaturalist project or an identified dataset from a city-based wildlife rescue organisation.

It invites visitors to explore how habitat fragmentation impacts the only Indian non-human ape species in a human-altered landscape.

Visitors engage (10 minutes each) with a 4 × 5 ft illustrated map representing ~2.5 sq. km of gibbon habitat. Using information cards and stickers, they step into the gibbon’s world, tracing their navigational routes shaped by canopy connectivity while marking risks, rewards, and uncertainties encountered along the way. Behavioral and ecological data thus becomes experiential through negotiation of movement paths to maximize rewards over risks in the fragmented habitat.

Data drives the work by addressing what conventional GIS misses: fine-scale risks in disturbed habitats. GIS data is integrated with ground-truthed field data to create an illustrated map from the gibbon’s POV. Real routes and field observations inform gibbon interaction points, understanding of risks and rewards, guiding the visitor interaction-mediated data visualization.

At its core, the work asks what habitat-fragmentation means for an arboreal species' daily decisions. It reveals how landscapes that appear lush to human eyes and satellites may still hide risks for a non-human, opening reflection on human-wildlife coexistence.

Set in Barekuri, where a small isolated gibbon population persists, thanks to their resilience and local compassion, in a rapidly shrinking-habitat rife with threats from infrastructural development, this project supports local conservation efforts by making ecological-data accessible.

Aligned with Data, Otherwise, the work foregrounds more-than-human data: gibbon movements are treated not merely as coordinates but as non-human decision points & spatial knowledge. By shifting data from static maps to a participatory playable form, it proposes an alternative format beyond charts & purely quantitative, and beyond the solely human.","Gibbon Moves is rooted in primatologist Ishika Ramakrishna’s existing doctoral research data on gibbon behavior and ecology. We integrate spatial data along with qualitative data from field observations and community interviews on landscape-use and vegetation patterns, gibbon movement tracks and key interaction points of the apes in the habitat to illuminate on route possibilities, and potential for reward and risks along the way based on habitat composition. Rewards for gibbons include the ease of navigation (presence of tall trees with wide canopy), presence of foraging opportunities (fruiting-trees, friendly humans) while risks arise from sparse navigational routes due to canopy gaps, lack of food resources, etc. Electrical cables are double-edged swords as they are usually used for navigation but when damaged or during rain can have electrocution risks. We intend to display quantitative outcomes of each visitor-mapped-route (risk-vs-reward & safety score of each route) as charts on a large score-card.","Data on habitat composition and key gibbon interaction points are visible on the illustrated map. Behavioral & ecological data emerges through participation as visitors use information cards and color-coded (risk/reward/double-edged) & number-coded (route ID) stickers to trace movement paths. The visualization is print-based, experiential, and participatory. 

A print will show the contrasts in fine-scale data between the GIS & illustrated maps.

Question, Reflection, Discussion:
Scale: What fine-scale ecological risks remain invisible in conventional maps?
Impact: How might alternative ecological data visualization formats shift how we perceive threats to species by extending our perception of shared, altered space?

While locally grounded, the issues of coexistence & conservation exist beyond Barekuri. For the rights of nature to be integrated into conservation beyond protected areas, cultivating research-informed ecological awareness and empathy for wildlife in shared spaces is a critical first step—one this work tries to address.",https://storage.tally.so/private/Gibbon-Moves_Project-Images_SAMBITA.pdf?id=b640p0&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6ImI2NDBwMCIsImZvcm1JZCI6ImxiZXlndiIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTE0Mjk4MH0.WEqsdytKTJ6iOzgSViwN9fB6Pfcat-0W2jtsXEoenio&signature=b64cd4bf39d630a5398f9e0dcb87189549c191f402851b6ae8fa5f2ccb8f1d5a,"Stable mounting for the 4 ft x 5 ft printed illustrated map for visitor interaction.

For the exhibition, we propose to refine and expand the participatory elements by designing information cards and color-/number-coded stickers that more clearly translate behavioral and ecological data into interactive decision-making.

Depending on budget, we can further expand the illustrated map to represent greater habitat complexity within the home range, and introduce a score chart that makes route safety scores, risk–reward trade-offs, and number of safe routes legible as aggregated data/charts (for the more quantitative audience).

We require approximately 1 month to revisit existing data, 1.5 months to produce the cards, stickers, score-chart, 1 month for map expansion (if undertaken), 0.5 month buffer, and a few hours for installation. The work can be completed and installed within the exhibition schedule.

Drawing on publicly available data, the installation will take the form of an interactive map through which visitors can zoom into different regions and encounter narratives of how humans and other-than-human beings (in this context, wildlife) continue to share space in an increasingly fragmented and rapidly changing world.

Rather than framing multispecies relations through the dominant conflict-centred narratives, the work foregrounds coexistence as a dynamic and evolving process shaped by cultural meaning, mutual interdependence, and everyday practices of adaptation and negotiation. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s concept of multispecies entanglements, the project understands humans and other-than-humans as inseparable and co-constitutive participants of complex, often messy webs of life.
The interface will be designed as a participatory archive where visitors can contribute their own experiences and reflections, allowing the map to grow into a visually emergent, mycelial network of interconnected multispecies relationalities. Through this evolving structure, the installation challenges binary understandings of conflict and coexistence, presenting instead a rich tapestry of imagination, interaction, and lived experience.

We hope to engage visitors both visually and affectively (approximately 5–15 minutes per journey) and invite them to reflect on how these relationships may transform under accelerating socio-ecological change and environmental collapse. The idea is to propel us to think about what forms of knowledge, connection, and possibilities we risk losing. Ultimately, the work expands how we understand data itself, positioning stories, relations, and embodied knowledge as vital forms of evidence for imagining more just and relational futures.","The project draws on a database of publicly available coexistence stories sourced from popular and academic articles, news media, blogs, public social media posts, and online videos. Currently, the archive includes approximately 68 cases (with more being added), collected through snowball sampling, where new examples are identified through references, links, and connections emerging from previously collected stories. We are presently conducting a qualitative content analysis to examine key elements within these narratives, including the values, norms, and practices represented; the actors and knowledge holders shaping the narratives; the species and ecological contexts discussed; and associated challenges, tensions, or threats. This helps identify patterns and relational themes across diverse landscapes, which will then be translated into spatial and narrative layers within the interactive installation. The exhibition format will experiment with ways of transforming this analysis into an accessible and impactful visual experience.
","
The installation is envisioned as an immersive, interactive spatial interface centred on a large digital map developed through the ArcGIS StoryMap platform. Visitors navigate by zooming into regions across India, where each geographic node reveals textual or audio-visual content. It will be complemented by panels that set the context. The visual language emphasises relationality, allowing non-linear movement through interconnected stories. Each node functions as a multimodal layer, weaving interviews, short films, graphic illustrations, photographs, embedded maps, and resource manuals so that different forms of knowledge can be encountered together rather than hierarchically. Over time, visitor contributions appear as additional nodes, growing into a mycelial network reflecting interconnected human–more-than-human relationships. The aesthetic approach aims to balance cartographic clarity with affective storytelling, encouraging slow exploration and reflection rather than passive viewing.",https://storage.tally.so/private/Sketches-_-Concept-Ideations-for-VizChitra-Data-Exhibition-.pdf?id=5plz2Q&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVwbHoyUSIsImZvcm1JZCI6ImxiZXlndiIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTE1OTc0Nn0.3YFdJ63QN0tmnT9vyo5QD9vNplupaXyu9OlfdHE2mJg&signature=38ba1558a054879bf3e42f081af3b5c028125abb17f11fcf73b45dd385a6ab7c,"-Large interactive display (touchscreen or projected interface with touch-enabled or mouse/trackpad navigation)

Ever wondered whether a bouquet of roses is the right gift to win a lover’s heart? This project reimagines the Valentine’s Day bouquet as something built rather than bought; assembled piece by piece to reveal the environmental journeys folded into this gesture of love.
Visitor experience
Visitors build a bouquet of roses whilst understanding the meaning of each tangible data part therein. Each rose is divided into elements that carry its environmental story: petals represent carbon footprint; the five-sided flower head : 5 main countries from which the UK imports roses; segmented stems trace water and chemical inputs; and thorns, or stem markers, indicate pesticide exposure. Through touch and repetition, the pace slows. Visitors linger, count, and notice, encountering data as weight carried by love.
Why data is central
The bouquet takes its shape directly from data. Data determines form, proportion, and structure, transforming global figures into something that can be held and understood through touch.
The question & context
Around 250 million roses are sold worldwide every 14 February. When the Feast of Saint Valentine was declared in AD 496, such planetary consequences were unimaginable. Initially imagined in the Indian context, the project now focuses on the UK due to clearer trade and environmental data availability there.
Why it fits Data, Otherwise
Dormant in winter, February roses are grown out of season or far away, sustained by greenhouses, chemicals, refrigeration, and long journeys. The project focuses on more-than-human data: red roses, water, chemicals, and climate and leaves the participant questioning about the choice of valentine gift. ","The project draws on quantitative and contextual data related to the Valentine’s Day rose supply chain. This includes numerical data on carbon footprints per rose and per bouquet, water and chemical inputs in commercial rose cultivation, UK and global trade and import statistics, and evidence of pesticide residues on imported cut flowers.

Carbon footprint data is synthesised from publicly available lifecycle assessments and UK consumer-facing analyses, including reports by Fairtrade International, Wageningen University & Research, and UK-based sustainability analyses (e.g. Alectro). Trade and import data comes from UN Comtrade via the World Integrated Trade Solution. Information on pesticide exposure is drawn from testing and reporting by PAN Europe, as reported by The Guardian.

All data is gathered through desk research of open, publicly accessible sources and translated into physical units that directly shape the form of the bouquet.","The data is visualised as a participatory sculptural installation in which visitors physically build a bouquet of roses. Each rose is composed of modular parts whose size, number, and structure are determined by specific datasets: petals accumulate carbon footprint, five-sided flower heads map countries of origin, segmented stems represent water and chemical inputs, and thorns mark pesticide exposure. A simple legend guides interpretation, but understanding emerges through handling, comparison, and assembly.
The work raises questions about scale, invisibility, and impact: What does an ordinary red rose hold when its supply chain is made tangible? How do demand of red roses affect the global systems of extraction, transport, and energy? By slowing the act of giving into an act of building, the installation invites discussion around attention, responsibility, and the cost of biodiversity loss to produce red roses on vast hectares of land, fuelled just by a single day.

A small vertical panel or wall space is needed to display the legend explaining the data mappings. Basic ambient lighting is sufficient, though focused overhead lighting would help in reading legend.
","This is a new project currently in the design and prototyping phase. The conceptual framework, data sources, and visualisation logic have been established, and the work is structured to be lightweight and modular. Following selection, the project can be completed within the exhibition schedule. The first phase will involve finalising datasets and material specifications (3-4 days), followed by fabrication and assembly of modular components (1-2 weeks). Final testing and refinement will take place in the weeks leading up to installation. The installation itself is straightforward and can be completed on-site within a few hours.

Visitors from a diverse backgrounds (journalists, media, reporters, artists, data visualization consultants, scientists) trace a seamless path from raw waste volume to behavioral drivers, perceiving lab culture's interconnected impact:

1. Confrontation: A 3D “inside-out” R&D lab discard bin, scaled to one month/week of real waste, built entirely from used consumables. Sparse labels like “This is one paper” or “This is six months of experiments” evoke discomfort, priming reflection on habits' scale.

2. Data Layer: Posters visualize survey insights on reusability variations by experiment type, optimization cycles, and training phases—directly linking the bin's volume to quantified behaviors and infrastructure gaps.

3. Interactive Simulation: In “Design Your Experiment,” visitors act as scientists, navigating trade-offs in rigor, speed, cost, and reuse under realistic constraints. Their choices generate a personalized material footprint, revealing how daily decisions—not inevitability—drive the waste seen earlier.

This progression transforms perception: the bin's shock yields data-driven clarity, culminating in empowering action.

Why It Matters

India's 7-8 million biomedical workers generate ~770 tonnes of waste daily, emitting roughly 385 tonnes CO₂e via incineration. As GenZ emerges as India’s future leaders in the biomedical sector and the most climate-conscious generation, we aim to spark dialogue that makes sustainable life-science research a reality, redefining sustainability as systemic design rather than reduced rigor and urging funding agencies and institutions to reward waste-aware practices while upholding scientific integrity.","Data from questionnaires will target students, professors, research assistants, and postdocs across institutional laboratories, using a validated list of consumables and their reuse/discard tendencies. This will uncover nuances such as research themes, experiment stages (optimization vs. final runs), and training phases that influence disposal behavior.
We will design a structured questionnaire featuring:
1. A standardized list of common lab consumables
2. Reuse likelihood (Likert scale)
3. Primary disposal reasons (multiple choice)
4. Context variables (lab role, experiment type, training level)

The questionnaire will be circulated for one month across all affiliated laboratories within a selected institution to ensure a sufficient and consistent sample size. If time permits, we may expand the survey to a second institution.","We will analyze both qualitative and quantitative responses to generate the following visualizations:
1. Heatmap: Reuse Likelihood by Lab Role: This visualization highlights behavioral tendencies across hierarchy.
Rows: Items, 
Columns: Roles (students, postdocs, professors), 
Color intensity: % favoring reuse

2. Grouped Bar Chart: Reasons for Disposal
X-axis: Top reasons (protocol-driven, contamination risk, time pressure, lack of infrastructure), Bars grouped by consumable type
This connects disposal behavior to structural and infrastructural constraints.

To ensure methodological rigor, responses will be anonymized and analyzed using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulation to identify significant behavioral trends.

While humans are offered warnings, thresholds, and protective measures, animals live through the same changing atmosphere without shields, advisories, or choice.

Visitors encounter a series of printed posters composed of archived newspaper articles, visual excerpts, and stills from videos documenting animals affected by pollution, heatwaves, fires, and ecological stress. Text and images are selectively highlighted to show different forms of distress in different species such as breathing difficulty, displacement, injury, and death, across urban, forest, and riverine contexts. The experience invites slow reading and reflection rather than immediate conclusions.

Archived news articles and videos function as qualitative data, revealing recurring patterns and gaps in how animal climate distress is recorded. CZA mortality records, AQI and temperature data determine which locations, periods, and forms of distress are visualized. The visualizations organize, compare, and layer these datasets to make exposure, vulnerability, and absence visible, guiding interpretation rather than illustrating conclusions.

At its core, the project asks How do non-human lives experience climate distress in a world where protection, adaptation, and response systems are designed primarily for humans? What does climate distress look like for lives that cannot adapt, protect themselves, even within spaces designed for their safety?

Set within Indian cities, forests, and rivers, the project reflects on a shared atmosphere shaped by human activity, where animals inhabit environments that are increasingly unstable, polluted, and hostile.

By working beyond conventional numerical datasets and focusing on experiential, archival, and qualitative evidence, the project expands how climate data can be visualized- focusing on vulnerability, exposure, and unequal protection across species.","The project draws from archived newspaper articles & video reports documenting animals affected by pollution, heatwaves, forest fires, & ecological disruption across cities, forests, and rivers. These materials act as qualitative data, capturing lived experiences that are often episodic and inconsistently recorded. The limited and uneven coverage in news reporting also points to absence: while scientific research and studies on climate impacts are ongoing, public-facing data on animal distress remains sparse and easily overlooked. Mortality records & causes of death from Central Zoo Authority reports are examined to understand patterns of respiratory and climate-related distress among animals living in protected environments such as zoos. These records are placed alongside AQI and temperature data sourced from weather reports corresponding to the same periods and locations. Rather than claiming direct causation, the project attempts to highlight overlap, exposure, and vulnerability within shared environments.","The project is presented as a series of printed posters, a collage, with optional screen-based elements. Archived news articles and video reports are treated as qualitative data and distilled into timelines and selected excerpts, revealing repetition, silence, and gaps in coverage. Each poster focuses on a different group of species—land animals, birds, aquatic life, and zoo animals, with key facts foregrounded visually. Zoo animal mortality data from CZA reports is represented through illustrated animal icons, color-coded by diagnosed causes such as respiratory illness or organ failure. AQI & temperature data are visualized as heat maps and atmospheric gradients. Collage of newspaper articles will be made to examine how climate crises are talked about in public & how animal suffering is frequently marginal. The work asks viewers to notice how animals experience environmental change without protection or choice, prompting reflection on responsibility, visibility, and the limits of existing data systems.",https://storage.tally.so/private/Vizchitra-Exhibition-Ideation.pdf?id=GQoqoo&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IkdRb3FvbyIsImZvcm1JZCI6ImxiZXlndiIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTE3MTc3M30.lmst-k_r2NzOqW9MSrH7RriI-0STjk2pKolZJo0XjSc&signature=cc1a7862da51757ba16492b5a96937421a2e52676345bbda7836613a95f87665,"The work primarily requires wall space for a series of printed posters, arranged sequentially to encourage close reading and comparison.

Air Quality Index (AQI) has become a regular topic of discussion. However, there is a sensory gap between seeing a number and understanding its toll on health. As the effects of poor air quality on the respiratory system are often invisible, it remains a challenge to perceive the urgency of the crisis. To address this, we propose an immersive, embodied experience that translates numbers into a visceral physical experience. 
The proposed exhibition allows participants to experience what the strain on the lungs may feel like at various AQI levels in different cities in India. The participants engage in this envisioned somesthetic experience by wearing a half jacket made of sturdy strings that represent microscopic pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 [CPCB] entering the lungs. Within the exhibition, participants move to ‘cities’ with varying AQIs. The sensors attached to the jacket introduce a gradual constriction based on AQI data, simulating the increased effort required to breathe. 
Using publicly available AQI data, this experience makes numbers a tangible reality—making the ‘unseen’ realities behind AQI ‘felt’. We also use audio snippets from citizens and experts, highlighting lived experiences, resilience, and adaptation to climate change. The aspiration for the proposed exhibition is to grow into an embodied experience that brings attention to policymakers and individuals to take immediate action to control air pollution. 
","In this exhibition, we use publicly available open-source AQI data to drive the physical experience. Rather than visualizing this data directly, it is converted into varying degrees of pressure experienced through the wearable jacket. By doing so, we transform data into a ‘felt’ physical discomfort. 
To add depth to the experience, we also intend to integrate a layer of qualitative data. The experience will feature snippets of first-hand accounts from citizens (from media pieces) describing symptoms and challenges, and expert interviews. The qualitative data will be used in the form of sound, as narrations in the background through a headphone during the experience.
","In the allotted space, rubber tiles represent 10 - 15 Indian cities from different geographies and AQI levels. Participants wear a half-jacket made of sturdy strings, symbolizing microscopic pollutants entering the lungs. As they stand on different tiles, sensors on the jacket exert or release pressure, physically simulating difficulty or ease of breathing in that city. The names of the cities remain hidden beneath the tiles, encouraging participants to explore before finding out the location. At two random cities, the participants will be asked to pick ‘movement challenge cards’ (such as stretching, running, etc.), and experience the effort under ‘good’ versus ‘severe’ AQI. For participants who are uncomfortable using the jacket, headbands/ hand bands would be provided as alternatives. Finally, participants enter a booth to watch a video on systemic challenges and expert interviews. The last part of the experience is answering reflective questions on a post-it wall, which becomes a live data visualisation there.

","This is a new proposal, and the work is ready to begin. Our team has a solid background working in embodied interaction projects and designing exhibitions. The team’s diverse experience in design, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and expertise with technology will help us hit the ground running and build the experience within a timeline of 3 weeks upon selection for the first prototype to go live.

We use data, integrated analysis, and strategic outreach to support public policy, transform markets, shape technology, and nudge behaviour. CEEW seeks to explain – and change – the use, reuse, and misuse of resources. It addresses pressing global challenges through an integrated and internationally focused approach. Approach. The Council prides itself on the independence of its high-quality research and strives to impact sustainable development at scale.

At Scale is trying to break away from that. 

Stretching across a large wall, it traces the growth of renewable energy capacity in India from 2015 to 2025. The visual language is minimal: a field of dots, where each dot represents a fixed unit of energy capacity, ~10 MW. In early years, the dots are sparse and small—so small that, viewers must peer or use magnifying glasses to see clearly. As viewers move, the dots multiply, grow denser, and increase in size, reflecting the dramatic acceleration of India’s energy transition towards clean energy, evidenced by the fact that between 2020 and 2024, India installed more solar capacity than it did in its entire history. By the final years, the numbers and dots become difficult to absorb at eye-level, forcing viewers to step back, look up, and reposition to comprehend the scale of change.

The chart borrows from our book, Local Grids to Global Power—a data-driven visual journey of India’s energy transition. The transition is not separate from adaptation—it is one of its most visible forms: a large-scale act of resilience that reshapes grids, economies, and everyday routines. Presenting at Data, Otherwise is an opportunity to extend the storytelling. Instead of offering a single, static scale, our installation demands movements from the audience. Understanding emerges only through shifting distance, either through close inspection that reveals detail or through stepping back, which reveals the larger transition underway. 

Embedded within the dots are lived experiences as annotations—written stories and/or QR codes to videos of communities and individuals navigating climate change. When seen together, they surface the frictions of the transition, negotiations people make with it, and lives that are influenced by aggregate numbers. ","Our data is at two levels—numeric data about India’s capacity installations between 2015 and 2025, and stories of lived experiences embedded in the visual as annotations. These will be stories of adaptation, disruption, and most importantly, local resilience. An example of these can be found in Faces of Climate Resilience (FCR), a documentary series from CEEW.

","We intend to create the visualisations digitally. However, we are open to experimenting with the physical medium. A draft of the chart we are looking to reimagine is attached to this application. The original chart looks at data from 2020 to 2025 and visualises one circle as 100 MW. In the exhibition, we want to decrease this unit further—one circle representing 1 or even 10 MW—to increase the density and scale of the data.

Materials—such as sunboard—to print or emboss the visual on. Magnifying glasses to see the energy transition in the earliest years up close. Benches placed at a distance to allow viewers to sit and take in the transition at scale.,"The data for the project has already been collected. The original visual was featured in our book, Local Grids to Global Power. For the exhibition, we will be extending the same visual and taking it beyond the page. 

Given that the data and concept already exist, we will need roughly 2-3 weeks to draft the final exhibit ans we're confident we can install it within schedule. ",I consent to VizChitra publishing my submission and the review of my application.,TRUE,,Keep,Under Review
