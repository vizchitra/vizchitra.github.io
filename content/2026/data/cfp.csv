[a] place achieves concrete reality when our experience of it is total, that is through all the senses”. Our personal memories of a place are situated in fleeting sensory experiences – the waft of the petrichor, bird songs scoring the background, bakery aromas, sounds of traffic and footfalls whizzing by. This interplay between our senses structures and mediates our sense of a place. However, traditional mapping practices — deriving their methods from scientific paradigms — view maps as objective and immutable artefacts to measure and notate the world. These provide limited guidance for observing, collecting and representing such subjective, qualitative data. 

Map-making has a long history of development, where methods for recording and representing geographical information have been refined over centuries (Abrams and Hall, 2008). In recent years, there has been a rise in humanistic approaches to data visualisation, and cartography is now primed for a similar expansion of perspectives. 

My talk centers on data experiences that highlight the rich, interconnected web of sensory information underlying our everyday encounters. Showcasing the process behind my work, I examine alternate forms of data collection, such as visual ethnography, score-based data walks, collective mapping, and the design of data experiences that encourage a deeper connection with the places we inhabit.",https://priti.is/mappingintangibles,https://atlasofintangibles.com,https://priti.is/datawalking,"Yes, many times"

Common gender factors such as labor force participation, income, growth, and financial inclusion are often presented as merely facts. However, the mathematical and methodological choices behind these numbers: the averages and categorizations often influence whose experiences will be shown and whose will remain hidden in sight.

The core idea of this talk is that economics and mathematics work as narrative tools in public media than being just jargonized technical tools. When gender is treated as a thought for later, stories risk reinforcing systematic invisibility rather than challenging inequality. By examining how data is presented, this talk asks how public media can represent economic realities more inclusively.

This topic matters to me because my work lies at the intersection of economics, mathematics, and researched-based public writing, with special focus on gender, culture and social structures. Through researching for articles and writing about social factors, I have repeatedly encountered gaps between lived gendered experiences and the way economic data is presented in media, public and policy debates. This talk grows out of that tension and goes all the way towards connecting directly to conversations in data visualization around ethics, representation, and accessibility in writing and policy contexts. It also focuses on the responsibility of data practitioners to question dominant visual factors rather than reproducing them without critically thinking about them.

The talk will follow a clear structure: first, outlining how economic data is commonly visualized in public media. Second, it will examine how specific mathematical and data choices flatten gendered labor and care work. Third, it will be analyzing examples where visualization either conceals or reveals inequality and lastly, it will offer practical solutions through frameworks that will integrate gender into economic data stories.

The intended audience includes students, media people, writers researchers, analysts, and practitioners working with socio-economic and mathematical data.

Key takeaways will include ways to question headline numbers, strategies to integrate gender into economic narratives, and methods for designing data visualizations that are both rigorous and socially accountable.",https://linktr.ee/learneducatepeople,https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2024/09/decoded-the-math-of-ghost-jobs,https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2024/10/explained-fighting-against-rising-crimes-on-women-in-india/,I have never given a talk

Recently I worked with BMTC, WRI India and Villgro at Bengawalk to redesign the 20-year-old maps at Bengaluru's most iconic bus station, Majestic. Majestic, the heart of the city's transit system, has 300+ bus routes, 36 platforms, a railway station, and now a metro interchange. With over 3-4 lakh daily visitors, clear navigation is essential. This talk is about the process that goes into making such data accessible: categorisation and filtering of public data, working out the design system based on user research and feedback, and working with the government to help them see the value of good design for cities. 

The core ideas of this talk:
1. The process behind map-making for citizens: user research and site analysis, data, design and implementation
2. India needs to invest in user-centric design to transform its cities
3. We can start small and think big— governments can invest in pilot projects in key areas before scaling to the broader city

Why is data visualisation so important for public design?
Most of the work we do at Bengawalk is about making the city of Bengaluru more accessible with design, tech and storytelling. Getting to do the data visualisation of public data —BMTC routes at Majestic Bus Station— was important because:
1. It makes the complex clear: people are now able to skim 150+ routes in seconds. Also, relationships between platforms and their directionalities in the city emerged for the first time, to the delight of both city nerds and regular commuters alike. 
2. It puts us in the minds of the people: it pushed us to analyse and understand how people actually navigate, instead of designing in a vacuum. This can be especially useful for government officials to experience in order to serve the people. 
3. It feels good: good design that helps you find your way can reduce unnecessary confusion and frustration. Also, it makes the space more pleasant and transparent. 
These are things that the people of any city deserve. 

The main sections and flow of the presentation:
1. The difference good wayfinding & signage can make
2. The process behind making the maps for BMTC Majestic: 
			2.1 user research and site analysis
			2.2 categorising and filtering public data
			2.3 working out the design system
			2.4 public feedback, stakeholder feedback, and multiple iterations 
			2.5 on-site implementation
3. Why data visualisation so important for public design
4. How to make the government value and invest in good design for cities

I want to re-introduce maps where they assign equal visual space to each state.

I want people to explore how creating and using alternative map designs, they can challenge some visual biases that they may unknowingly hold. By giving each state equal visual weight, I am challenging the viewer to engage with the underlying data rather than subconsciously ignoring trends in smaller states, particularly the NE region.

This matters to me because states which perform really well in a policy arena get left out when they are visualized by performance. When this data, such as school enrollment rates, or health outcomes are mapped using traditional maps, there are some times when small states don't get the attention they deserve- their success stories can disappear in plain sight.

The talk will be structured in 4 parts. 

First I will visually unpack the bias we hold, I'll do this by showing important data and how small states end up in our blind spots.

Next, I will talk about how I approached this problem. Why I chose Hexagons, How I assigned them positions on an imaginary grid. Walk them through the construction process, which is largely non-digital, and the trade-offs I had to make between geography and design. This process was very manual and hands on and involved cutting physical hexagons and lots of trial and error.

Next, I will talk about creating a python function and turning it into a streamlit website to encode these into a visualization and how one can patch data to this function to create their own maps.

Finally, I will end with examples and cases where this map could be preferred over the traditional one and also when it probably won't be the best choice to visualize state data.

The intended audience for this project are likely college-going data enthusiasts who are looking to expand how they can viz tools which are relevant, and how they can turn simple visualization functions into easy-to-use websites.

The tooling has exploded with drag-and-drop builders, low-code platforms, ChatGPTs this, LLMs, chart libraries for everyone and their mothers, templates for every use case and all flavors of agentic coding. The time is ripe. Government departments, NGOs, and civic tech projects: everyone can ship a public data dashboard now, and everyone does. On the surface, this looks like progress. More data is being published. More interfaces exist. Accessibility is improving. The hammers have found their nails.

But I think something isn't working. The dashboards get built, launched, and maybe written about, but then they sit there, waiting for the next person to come along and build the same thing again. They look helpful with their filters, charts, maps, and download buttons. However, try to put them through their paces and the complexity turns out to be quite shallow.

I don't think the problem is technical skill or bad intentions. I'd argue it's inherited assumptions. These are ideas about what a dashboard should be that we absorbed from enterprise BI tools and never questioned for public contexts. We assume that if the data is there, it's accessible. Please don't question it any more. Can't you see the Big Ass Number? The Donut? The Bars? What more do you want, really?

Meanwhile, what we can build has changed. Not just technically, although browsers and tooling have capabilities that aren't being used nearly enough. It is a change in the possibilities of how we think about public data interfaces altogether. This talk is a discussion about that gap; between the dashboards we keep building and the public data infrastructure we need. Looking at what's working and what isn't across interfaces, from national portals to scrappy civic tech projects, and drawing on experiments at Diagram Chasing, I'll walk through what I think are design assumptions worth questioning, the technical possibilities worth exploring, and tiny (but big!) decisions that shape whether a data interface actually serves people the way it wants to.",www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NCUE02l1DE,https://iiith2025.diagramchasing.fun/#/title-slide,,"Yes, many times"

Large-scale enterprise environments, with their diverse workflows, data requirements, and design standards, highlight the need for a robust approach. This talk will explore how to build composable React chart components that serve as the foundation of scalable visualization systems, enabling teams to deliver interactive, customizable, and performant charts while maintaining cohesion, reducing duplication, and embedding accessibility from the ground up.

React provides the perfect foundation for composable chart components. By leveraging its component architecture, props, and hooks, developers can create modular, reusable, and adaptable charts that are platform aware and easy to extend. Accessibility through keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA-compliant elements should be baked in from the start, ensuring all users can interact with and understand the data. This approach allows teams to balance flexibility, consistency, and inclusivity, turning charts from isolated components into a coherent, scalable system.

The talk will demonstrate how to put these principles into practice. It will cover patterns for composable components, API design conventions, and strategies for reuse, along with approaches for customization and overrides that allow product-specific adaptations without breaking platform-wide consistency. Accessibility will be highlighted as a first-class concern, showing how to design charts that work for everyone without costly retrofits. Finally, the session will address scalability, performance, and long-term maintainability, illustrating how a React-based charting system can evolve to support multiple products, large datasets, and complex interactions over time.

This topic matters because building visualizations at scale is as much about engineering a system as it is about displaying data. Composable, reusable charts let teams respond quickly to new requirements, reduce duplication, and maintain consistency across products or platforms. When accessibility is built in from the start, these charts work for everyone, helping teams minimize technical debt, collaborate effectively, and evolve their visualization layer alongside the products it supports.

The intended audience includes front-end and visualization engineers, UI/UX designers, and technical product leads who work on platform-level products or large-scale analytics systems. By the end of the session, attendees will understand why composable, accessible chart patterns are critical for scalable platforms, how to design charts that balance flexibility and consistency, and practical strategies for implementing a maintainable, extensible, and inclusive visualization system.
