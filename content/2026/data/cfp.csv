[a] place achieves concrete reality when our experience of it is total, that is through all the senses”. Our personal memories of a place are situated in fleeting sensory experiences – the waft of the petrichor, bird songs scoring the background, bakery aromas, sounds of traffic and footfalls whizzing by. This interplay between our senses structures and mediates our sense of a place. However, traditional mapping practices — deriving their methods from scientific paradigms — view maps as objective and immutable artefacts to measure and notate the world. These provide limited guidance for observing, collecting and representing such subjective, qualitative data. 

Map-making has a long history of development, where methods for recording and representing geographical information have been refined over centuries (Abrams and Hall, 2008). In recent years, there has been a rise in humanistic approaches to data visualisation, and cartography is now primed for a similar expansion of perspectives. 

My talk centers on data experiences that highlight the rich, interconnected web of sensory information underlying our everyday encounters.

Common gender factors such as labor force participation, income, growth, and financial inclusion are often presented as merely facts. However, the mathematical and methodological choices behind these numbers: the averages and categorizations often influence whose experiences will be shown and whose will remain hidden in sight.

The core idea of this talk is that economics and mathematics work as narrative tools in public media than being just jargonized technical tools. When gender is treated as a thought for later, stories risk reinforcing systematic invisibility rather than challenging inequality. By examining how data is presented, this talk asks how public media can represent economic realities more inclusively.

This topic matters to me because my work lies at the intersection of economics, mathematics, and researched-based public writing, with special focus on gender, culture and social structures. Through researching for articles and writing about social factors, I have repeatedly encountered gaps between lived gendered experiences and the way economic data is presented in media, public and policy debates. This talk grows out of that tension and goes all the way towards connecting directly to conversations in data visualization around ethics, representation, and accessibility in writing and policy contexts. It also focuses on the responsibility of data practitioners to question dominant visual factors rather than reproducing them without critically thinking about them.

The talk will follow a clear structure: first, outlining how economic data is commonly visualized in public media. Second, it will examine how specific mathematical and data choices flatten gendered labor and care work. Third, it will be analyzing examples where visualization either conceals or reveals inequality and lastly, it will offer practical solutions through frameworks that will integrate gender into economic data stories.

The intended audience includes students, media people, writers researchers, analysts, and practitioners working with socio-economic and mathematical data.

Recently I worked with BMTC, WRI India and Villgro at Bengawalk to redesign the 20-year-old maps at Bengaluru's most iconic bus station, Majestic. Majestic, the heart of the city's transit system, has 300+ bus routes, 36 platforms, a railway station, and now a metro interchange. With over 3-4 lakh daily visitors, clear navigation is essential. This talk is about the process that goes into making such data accessible: categorisation and filtering of public data, working out the design system based on user research and feedback, and working with the government to help them see the value of good design for cities. 

The core ideas of this talk:
1. The process behind map-making for citizens: user research and site analysis, data, design and implementation
2. India needs to invest in user-centric design to transform its cities
3. We can start small and think big— governments can invest in pilot projects in key areas before scaling to the broader city

Why is data visualisation so important for public design?
Most of the work we do at Bengawalk is about making the city of Bengaluru more accessible with design, tech and storytelling. Getting to do the data visualisation of public data —BMTC routes at Majestic Bus Station— was important because:
1. It makes the complex clear: people are now able to skim 150+ routes in seconds. Also, relationships between platforms and their directionalities in the city emerged for the first time, to the delight of both city nerds and regular commuters alike. 
2. It puts us in the minds of the people: it pushed us to analyse and understand how people actually navigate, instead of designing in a vacuum. This can be especially useful for government officials to experience in order to serve the people. 
3. It feels good: good design that helps you find your way can reduce unnecessary confusion and frustration. Also, it makes the space more pleasant and transparent. 
These are things that the people of any city deserve. 

The main sections and flow of the presentation:
1. The difference good wayfinding & signage can make
2. The process behind making the maps for BMTC Majestic: 
			2.1 user research and site analysis
			2.2 categorising and filtering public data
			2.3 working out the design system
			2.4 public feedback, stakeholder feedback, and multiple iterations

I want to re-introduce maps where they assign equal visual space to each state.

I want people to explore how creating and using alternative map designs, they can challenge some visual biases that they may unknowingly hold. By giving each state equal visual weight, I am challenging the viewer to engage with the underlying data rather than subconsciously ignoring trends in smaller states, particularly the NE region.

This matters to me because states which perform really well in a policy arena get left out when they are visualized by performance. When this data, such as school enrollment rates, or health outcomes are mapped using traditional maps, there are some times when small states don't get the attention they deserve- their success stories can disappear in plain sight.

The talk will be structured in 4 parts. 

First I will visually unpack the bias we hold, I'll do this by showing important data and how small states end up in our blind spots.

Next, I will talk about how I approached this problem. Why I chose Hexagons, How I assigned them positions on an imaginary grid. Walk them through the construction process, which is largely non-digital, and the trade-offs I had to make between geography and design. This process was very manual and hands on and involved cutting physical hexagons and lots of trial and error.

Next, I will talk about creating a python function and turning it into a streamlit website to encode these into a visualization and how one can patch data to this function to create their own maps.

Finally, I will end with examples and cases where this map could be preferred over the traditional one and also when it probably won't be the best choice to visualize state data.

The intended audience for this project are likely college-going data enthusiasts who are looking to expand how they can viz tools which are relevant, and how they can turn simple visualization functions into easy-to-use websites.

Large-scale enterprise environments, with their diverse workflows, data requirements, and design standards, highlight the need for a robust approach. This talk will explore how to build composable React chart components that serve as the foundation of scalable visualization systems, enabling teams to deliver interactive, customizable, and performant charts while maintaining cohesion, reducing duplication, and embedding accessibility from the ground up.

React provides the perfect foundation for composable chart components. By leveraging its component architecture, props, and hooks, developers can create modular, reusable, and adaptable charts that are platform aware and easy to extend. Accessibility through keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA-compliant elements should be baked in from the start, ensuring all users can interact with and understand the data. This approach allows teams to balance flexibility, consistency, and inclusivity, turning charts from isolated components into a coherent, scalable system.

The talk will demonstrate how to put these principles into practice. It will cover patterns for composable components, API design conventions, and strategies for reuse, along with approaches for customization and overrides that allow product-specific adaptations without breaking platform-wide consistency. Accessibility will be highlighted as a first-class concern, showing how to design charts that work for everyone without costly retrofits. Finally, the session will address scalability, performance, and long-term maintainability, illustrating how a React-based charting system can evolve to support multiple products, large datasets, and complex interactions over time.

This topic matters because building visualizations at scale is as much about engineering a system as it is about displaying data. Composable, reusable charts let teams respond quickly to new requirements, reduce duplication, and maintain consistency across products or platforms. When accessibility is built in from the start, these charts work for everyone, helping teams minimize technical debt, collaborate effectively, and evolve their visualization layer alongside the products it supports.

The intended audience includes front-end and visualization engineers, UI/UX designers, and technical product leads who work on platform-level products or large-scale analytics systems. By the end of the session, attendees will understand why composable, accessible chart patterns are critical for scalable platforms, how to design charts that balance flexibility and consistency, and practical strategies for implementing a maintainable, extensible, and inclusive visualization system.

The tooling has exploded with drag-and-drop builders, low-code platforms, ChatGPTs this, LLMs, chart libraries for everyone and their mothers, templates for every use case and all flavors of agentic coding. The time is ripe. Government departments, NGOs, and civic tech projects: everyone can ship a public data dashboard now, and everyone does. On the surface, this looks like progress. More data is being published. More interfaces exist. Accessibility is improving. The hammers have found their nails.

I think public data dashboards should be infrastructure, not publications. Many dashboards get built, launched, and maybe written about, but then they sit there, waiting for the next person to come along and build the same thing again. They look helpful with their filters, charts, maps, and download buttons. However, try to put them through their paces and the complexity turns out to be quite shallow. I don't think the problem is technical skill or bad intentions. I'd argue it's inherited assumptions. These are ideas about what a dashboard should be that we absorbed from enterprise BI tools and never questioned for public contexts. We assume that if the data is there, it's accessible. Please don't question it anymore. Can't you see the Big Ass Number? The Donut? The Bars? What more do you want, really?

Meanwhile, what we can build has changed. Not just technically, although browsers and tooling have capabilities that aren't being used nearly enough. It is a change in the possibilities and expectations of how we think about public data interfaces altogether. This talk is a discussion about that gap; between the dashboards we keep building and the public data infrastructure we need. Looking at what's working and what isn't across interfaces, from national portals to scrappy civic tech projects, and drawing on experiments at [Diagram Chasing](https://diagramchasing.fun), I'll walk through: 

1. A critique of the current landscape of public infrastructure dashboards. 
2. What I think are design assumptions worth questioning specifically for this context. 
3. Showcase some of the new technical possibilities worth exploring. The FOSS ecosystem is better than ever. DuckDB WASM, PMTiles, MapLibre, webR, parquets in the browser, and so much more! What can be the new mental model of how to build public dashboards that cost $0 to host but are often better than enterprise tools? 
4. What I think are some tiny (but big!) decisions that shape whether a data interface serves people the way it wants to.

This session is for designers, civic technologists, developers, open-data enthusiasts, and anyone who builds public data interfaces or indeed, decides what gets built.

Grant programs publish where the money went. But can we quantify if it reached the problems that mattered most? This talk shows how we visualised $1M+ in community-driven funding for open-source software: not as a list of funded projects, but as capital flows from ecosystem challenges to the work that addresses them. This work engages questions about visualising complex allocation systems for designing feedback loops between community signals and strategic priorities. 

**Core ideas and context**

Most grant programs show you transactions: who received how much. That's transparency of allocation, not strategic clarity. In crowdfunding, the harder question is whether the aggregate of thousands of funding decisions actually maps to the priorities an ecosystem cares about.

We worked with a crowdfunding mechanism (Quadratic Funding) where donors collectively decide which open-source projects receive matching funds. It's radically transparent, where every donation and matching calculation is public. But transparency alone doesn't answer: 

> Are the most critical problems getting funded, or just the most visible ones?

Community funding has a structural bias. Work that's narratable, immediately useful, and easy to explain attracts donations. Ecosystem critical work that's long-horizon, coordination-heavy, or infrastructural struggles to compete for attention, even when donors intellectually agree it matters.

This data analysis bridged that gap. Starting from curated problem catalogues developed through domain sensemaking, including stakeholder interviews, ecosystem analysis, and expert judgment, we used AI-assisted methods to align each project to primary and secondary problem areas. The resulting visualisations traced funding flows from problem categories to individual projects, making it possible to ask: 

> Did the problems we identified as most critical actually attract the funding needed to solve them?

Rohit Malekar designs analytics systems that help blockchain-native communities translate messy grant data into clear, actionable insights to make better capital allocation decisions. He designs tools that reduce information asymmetry and make funding decisions more fair, transparent, and evidence-based for funders, donors, grant allocators, and domain experts. His work spans the grants ecosystem in  [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co), analytics with [Open Source Observer](http://opensource.observer), and climate impact initiatives with [Atlantis](http://atlantisp2p.com). He believes the best visualisations don’t just inform. They coordinate action. More at [rohitmalekar.in](http://rohitmalekar.in)

1. **Beyond Transparency** (3 min): What blockchain-native funding already solved and the strategic question it leaves open
2. **The Approach** (8 min): From problem catalogues to funding flows, a review of design choices, AI-assisted alignment, and visualisation trade-offs
3. **The Patterns** (4 min): What the visualisations revealed and a reusable framework for problem-level funding analysis

**Intended audience**

Practitioners designing visualisations for civic, nonprofit, or grant contexts—anyone building decision-support tools where users navigate unfamiliar domains under uncertainty.

**Key takeaways**

1. **A diagnostic question**: ""Does your dashboard show where money went, or whether it reached what mattered?"" offers a new lens for evaluating grant effectiveness.

2. **A mental model**: Position analysis as an invitation for inquiry, not a final judgment. Stakeholders are more likely to engage when they're co-investigators, not defendants.

3. **Design principle**: AI can handle the first-pass categorization at scale; humans refine and validate.

Instead, they drift into UX roles. This observation comes from years of hiring, mentoring, and working with designers across experience levels. 

The core idea of this talk is a reality check. I’ll explore why this drift happens, what skills from data visualization translate well into UX, and what gets lost along the way. I’ll challenge the assumption that data viz and UX are parallel, equally available career paths, and instead argue that data visualization often functions as a gateway skill rather than a long-term destination role in most product organizations.

The talk also looks forward. As AI tools increasingly automate visualization generation, chart selection, and interaction patterns, many traditional data visualization skills are becoming commoditized. Knowing which chart to use will matter less than knowing why it works, when it fails, and how to shape meaning, narrative, and clarity. In this future, designers will differentiate themselves not through tool mastery, but through taste, judgment, visual hierarchy, and the ability to frame data in context.

This topic matters deeply to me because I work at the intersection of design, data, and complex product systems, and I regularly engage with students and early-career designers who are trying to make sense of where data visualization fits in the real world. 

The talk is structured in three parts. First, a grounded look at career realities and patterns I’ve observed. Second, an exploration of the skills, traits, and mindsets that help data viz practitioners succeed and evolve, including curiosity, fast domain learning, and comfort with ambiguity. Third, a call to action for leaders and organizations on how to create more meaningful opportunities for data visualization designers beyond defaulting them into UX roles.

# Abstract

Despite overwhelming scientific evidence of the climate crisis, a massive gap remains between public knowledge and meaningful action. This phenomenon, often driven by the “Bystander Effect,” allows individuals to remain passive, assuming responsibility lies elsewhere.

This talk presents Carbon Block, a speculative design project that moves beyond traditional “positive reinforcement” (rewards/badges) to explore the power of negative motivators and physical inconvenience. By utilising “slow alarms”—data-driven inflatable sculptures—the project materialises abstract carbon metrics into physical obstacles.

We will walk through the design process—from analysing the psychology of procrastination to prototyping IoT-enabled soft-robotic systems—to demonstrate how design can transform invisible data into an unavoidable call for collective intervention.

## Project Background & Methodology

The project is rooted in a two-phase research process:

Phase I (The Setting): Identifying the urban middle class as the critical demographic for public dissent and analysing the “wicked problem” of a consumerist economy driven by perpetual growth.

Phase II (The Staging): Applying behavioural science to design. Using Cohen’s Tetrahedron (Environment, Technology, Economy, Culture) to map the factors shaping our world, the project identifies that humans are more likely to act when faced with the loss of comfort, time, or identity.

The Solution: The Carbon Block Sculpture

The core artefact consists of three components:
- A Chrome Armature: A rigid structure representing the fixed “Carbon Budget.”
- A Latex Inflatable: A balloon that expands in real-time based on the user’s consumption data.
- IoT Integration: An Arduino-based pneumatic system that pulls live consumption metrics and inflates the balloon.

When the balloon exceeds the volume of the armature, it creates visual and physical tension, signaling a “carbon overshoot” in a way that cannot be ignored or swiped away.",,,,I have never given a talk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

It contains a plethora of deities symbolysing ancient and rich spiritual lineages. Visitors in art galleries are often awestruck when they see a Thangka. Its intricate details contain a plethora of deities and stories. While the dense information arouses the visitor's curiosity, they get overwhelmed and lost as to what all this information signifies? How does the visitor unfurl these details and navigate through the portals of ancient knowledge?    The core idea of this talk is to demo the proposed solutions to the above questions.  If the Thangkas are represented on a digital ""canvas"", then creators can digitally annotate each iconography and story in a Thangka.
These digital annotations can be used as markers to link the details of the selected section and further categorisation and elaboration of the ancient spiritual lineages.
Each annotation ""bubble"" in a Thankga will contain the basic information of the icon eg. deity, event or story. The bubble will also contain links to:

1. The elaboration of the icon including links to purchase the artifact or browse through related artifacts.
2. The associated MindMap to categorise the icon in the appropriate Central Figure, Geographic Region, Religion or Lineage Affiliation, Period, Collection, Thematic Sets, Exhibition Appearances, Publication Appearances etc.

This topic connects to conversations in data viz by merging physical and digital mediums of communication through digitally annotated narratives. The overarching structure and design of the talk is based on the communication of Arts & Culture through digital mediums. The main sections and flow of the presentation are as follows:
1. Introduce the concept of Tibetan Thangkas - What, Where and How from a physical real world perspective.
2. Display the corpus of digital knowledge that is already available as textual web resources and that has been graphically organised into MindMaps.
3. Merge the physical and digital worlds into a coherent navigation to immerse the users into ancient spiritual knowledge.

The intended audience are:

1. Collectors of museums interested to navigate and purchase artifacts about Tibetan Buddhist spiritual lineages.
2. Scholars interested in researching Tibetan Buddhist history.
3. Visitors who would like to get initiated into the practice of Tibetan Buddhism.

The Ch(art) of Visualising Data with Vibe Coding,"Yes, many times","With large language models, coding has changed, and so has data visualisation. 

“The hottest new programming language is English”, says Andrej Karpathy, who coined the term vibe coding. Since 2025, interest in the term has surged globally (https://tinyurl.com/ykff2bua). Anywhere you look, charts, dashboard, infographics, microsites built through prompts and iteration show up.

For someone like me, who spent countless hours painstakingly building charts line by line in ggplot/R or discovering new libraries like cutecharts in Python, vibe coding was an exciting shift. It took away most of the manual labour of writing code, allowed me to experiment with D3.js and other interactive chart libraries with low effort. Most of all, it massively cut the time taken from idea to implementation. Now I could spin up a working dashboard in hours, not days.

Beyond changing how we make visualisations, vibe-coding is also changing what we feel while building them. When you can go from an idea to prototype in minutes, without the slow learning that once came from writing and debugging code, there is an emotional arc to your technical workflow.

There is the thrill of instant creation, followed quickly by unease: disbelief that it works, frustration when small things break, and a creeping sense of not knowing how to debug. It can be disillusioning to sit with the feeling that you made something but don't fully know how. Some days it can feed imposter syndrome, other days it can re-assure you that your fundamentals are in place. I find myself constantly negotiating with what I still need to know, what I can defer learning, and what I may no longer need to learn in the data visualisation process anymore.

This dialogue will explore similar tensions and dilemmas in the minds of data visualisers. Some questions we will reflect on: Where does one begin to vibe-code? What tools and workflows do we reach out for? Which decisions still belong to the maker, and which are delegated to the tool? Who does vibe-coding open doors for, and whose work does it reshape? What do we do when it exposes gaps in our skills? Is it a career skill that can be taught and learnt? In the hands of founders, product managers, and designers, has vibe-coding helped? How are developers experiencing this shift? And as we move faster, how do we ensure quality, rigour, creativity, and trust in our products? How do we coordinate, deliver and scale data visualisations with this new method? 

Based on the discussion, we’ll map the shifting _vibes_ of making visualisations through vibe-coding with a simple emoji-based exercise. Participants will create their own _vibe-check_ chart: time spent vibe-coding on the x-axis, and sentiments such as thrill, disbelief, self-doubt, bargaining, acceptance or more, felt with varying intensity in the process, on the y-axis. Emoji stickers will be cut out and placed on the chart to mark how these feelings rise and fall. A sample version here: https://tinyurl.com/53t9sd87

The session will help participants articulate where they feel confident, where they feel lost, and what they want to hold on to as the practice shifts. Bring your wins, failures, half-started experiments, or fully shipped vibe-coded charts, dashboards, and visual projects. This will be a candid conversation about the emotional experience of making dataviz in this brave new world.",https://tinyurl.com/ykff2bua,https://tinyurl.com/53t9sd87,,"1.

As a narrative consultant, I help organisations articulate who they are, what they believe, and why their messages work(or do not). Over time, this work has left me with a persistent discomfort. Almost every storytelling framework I rely on assumes a single main character.

This assumption is deeply embedded in how we understand stories. From Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey to Gustav Freytag’s pyramid, dominant narrative structures are built around individual agency, conflict, and resolution. Even when stories claim to be about communities, movements, or cultures, they almost always narrow down to one person at a time. Individual stories are easier to aspire to, easier to remember, and easier to operationalise. They have become accessible enough to shape films, novels, political messaging, and even corporate branding.

But the world we are trying to describe, societies, organisations, and publics, does not actually work that way.

This session begins with a question I keep returning to. What does the story of a community look like?
If agency is distributed, what is the unit of action? How do multiple narratives interact, overlap, or contradict one another? And what are we simplifying, or losing, when we keep reverting to individual story structures simply because they are easier to work with?

This question has been explored before, but rarely in ways that are easy to work with in practice. Thinkers such as Benedict Anderson, Georg Lukács, and Gustave Le Bon have all, in different ways, treated collectives as narrative subjects. Yet these ideas remain difficult to translate into usable structures. As a result, we continue to fall back on individual heroes, not because they are always accurate, but because they are workable.

A second question follows naturally. If stories shape behaviour, power, and meaning, why are they so hard to see? When we try to imagine what a story like The Lion King looks like, we recall iconic images such as Simba being lifted into the sky atop Pride Rock. What we visualise is the imagery of the story, not its narrative structure. We do not see the arc, the relationships, or the forces shaping the story over time. We lack a visual language for narrative itself, especially for collective narratives.

In my practice, I have been experimenting with narrative visualisations to make this invisible layer more visible. These are not finished systems or polished frameworks. They are sketches, models, and provocations that attempt to surface relationships, tensions, and narrative gravity inside organisations. I have found that visualising narratives makes it possible to begin working with collective story structures that remain abstract in text alone.

This talk is a sharing of that journey. I will walk through the problems that led me here, the visual experiments I have tried, and the gaps I have not been able to solve alone. The goal is not to present a solution, but to open up narrative visualisation as a design space that invites collaboration across data visualisation, design, development, and systems thinking.

Participants will leave with new ways of thinking about stories beyond protagonists, early patterns for visualising narratives as systems, and an invitation to explore what becomes possible when we start working before heroes emerge. If stories shape our collective reality, then building ways to see them should itself be a collective effort.",,,,"Yes, many times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Bollywood and India’s regional cinema together produce over a thousand movies a year, to entertain the world’s most populous country.

Some of the easiest conversations I’ve had with strangers often start over a film or film-star. Everyone has opinions, favourites, loyalties, hot takes, sometimes plain gossip. We say that movies are getting longer and louder, that the industry is running out of ideas, that audiences don’t go to theatres anymore, that everything is a remake, that actresses have a shelf life. In a star-obsessed country, films shape public mood and hugely influence how we speak, dress, and dream.

For an industry that entertains a billion-plus people, numbers matter. Every project carries investment in production, distribution, marketing and is judged based on footfalls on first-day-first-show, budgets, ratings, reviews, box-office returns. Every release leaves behind a long data trail after the opening-weekend chatter fades.

I’ve spent the last few years following that trail, labelling film data to see what the chatter looks like when you quantify and plot it. These small experiments have grown into a series of visual stories about the economics of movie-making in Bollywood, its risk-reward dynamics, on and off-screen representation, and changing tastes of audiences.

Using charts from my own work, and some that have inspired it, I’ll walk through these visual projects and the process behind them to show how data visualisation can help us read the script behind our movies.

Fall in love with metrics that actually commit.

In today’s AI-driven, dashboard-heavy workplaces, we are surrounded by numbers. Impressions rise. Followers grow. Views spike. Yet behind the applause of “good metrics,” many teams struggle to answer a simple question: Did this actually move the decision?

This talk explores the gap between metrics that look impressive and metrics that influence real-world outcomes. Drawing from experience working in institutional strategy, admissions marketing, and AI-led product environments, I will unpack how visualization often reinforces vanity rather than clarity — and how we can redesign it to drive action.

At its core, this session is about reframing how we think about data at work. Instead of optimizing for visibility, we should optimize for decision-making. Instead of building dashboards that perform well in presentations, we must build visual systems that survive executive scrutiny, budget cuts, and real-world constraints.

The talk will move through three main sections:

1. The Illusion of Impact
How vanity metrics emerge in organizations, why they are psychologically attractive, and how visualization design unintentionally amplifies them.

2. Designing for Commitment, Not Attention
Practical principles for creating visualizations that highlight decision-critical signals — conversion funnels, trade-offs, risk indicators, and opportunity costs. This includes aligning charts with stakeholder questions, simplifying noise, and structuring dashboards around action.

3. From Reporting to Influencing
Case reflections on how visualization shifts when it becomes part of workflow rather than an end-of-month artifact. What changes when data is designed to guide conversations instead of decorate slides?

This topic matters deeply to me because I have seen how easily teams mistake activity for impact. In AI and product-driven spaces especially, data can create a false sense of confidence. Thoughtful visualization is not just aesthetic craft — it is organizational responsibility.

Within broader data visualization conversations, this session contributes to the ongoing dialogue about ethics, communication, and decision-support systems. It bridges design, strategy, and domain practice by focusing not on tools, but on intent.

This talk is intended for analysts, designers, product teams, marketing professionals, and leaders who build or rely on dashboards in their daily work.

Participants will leave with:

A framework to distinguish vanity metrics from value metrics

A checklist for designing decision-oriented dashboards

Mental models for aligning visualizations with stakeholder questions

A new lens for evaluating whether their data is influencing or merely informing

Because at work, attention is easy to get. Commitment is harder.

In this talk, I will share an overview of how data literacy is being reimagined in the new NCERT textbooks developed under NEP 2020. I plan to walk through the progression of ideas and concepts related to data literacy from the early grades up to Grade 12, highlighting not just the knowledge outcomes but also the skills, dispositions, and critical attitudes we hope to nurture in learners.

This talk explores the hidden risks of automated data tools and explains why our desire for total simplicity is often the problem. In our rush to make everything effortless, we are creating ""leaky abstractions"" that hide the messy reality of data from the people making decisions.

The core of this session is ""The Human Edge."" As AI masters the ""Genius"" of making charts, human value must shift to ""Judgment."" This is a critical conversation because data tools are increasingly used in high-stakes areas like healthcare and public policy. When a tool makes a guess, but the interface shows a solid, certain line, users lose their ability to question the outcome. I will use ""Tesler's Law"" to explain that complexity cannot be destroyed; it can only be moved. If we move all complexity away from the user, we also move away from their sense of responsibility.

This topic matters because ""automated certainty"" is a danger to our communities. In the data visualisation world, we often focus on aesthetics or speed. This talk shifts the focus toward ethics and systems thinking. It connects to the VizChitra mission by showing how the tools we build for ""Work"" directly impact the ""Community.""

### What is it about?

Data visualisations are quite a common part of modern journalism and storytelling — from data graphics that go with a text-driven story to visualisation-driven narratives. This talk explores the role of thoughtful design and art direction in news design so that even the most complex or dry subjects can become immersive and impactful narratives.

We’ll look at stories that are perhaps not too heavy on data but include information that needs to be delivered with an impact. Through real-world examples — financial data, electoral explanations, and so on, we’ll look at visual stories that not only inform but also engage the readers/viewers in an era of shrinking attention spans and information overload.   

Attendees will gain a framework for identifying visual opportunities, collaborating with designers and developers, and rethinking how information is structured for maximum impact. 

### Who is it for?

This is for anyone trying to ideate and create novel ways to represent data and information in digital publications. Whether you’re a journalist, editor, designer, or developer, this session will inspire you to move beyond the limitations of text and embrace the power of interactive narrative design to create stories that not only inform—but captivate your audience.

### What’s in it?

1. Understanding of narrative design and interaction patterns using examples from news media.
2. A framework for identifying visual opportunities, collaborating with designers and developers, and rethinking how information is structured for maximum impact.
3. Knowledge of how data, when artistically presented, can drive stories rather than being dry charts and graphics in a supporting role with text.

This talk will serve as a refresher on how far we have come in using data for narrative design and will explore examples where page design and art direction played a critical role in turning the story into an experience. e.g. https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GERMANY-ELECTION/ECONOMY/zjpqaqdorpx/ As the digital space gets saturated with interactive charts, dashboards, and linear stories, it is our responsibility as information designers to rethink and reimagine how we might captivate our audiences with well-designed information experiences.",https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GERMANY-ELECTION/ECONOMY/zjpqaqdorpx/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ELECTION/POLLING/gdpzdolqxpw/,https://medium.com/diarium-da-pacific,"Yes, many times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Shaurabh Anand, Gopi Sankar G

This workshop explores how organisations, researchers, students, and community members can transform data analysis into persuasive, audience-centred narratives. Across sectors, whether in research, policy, business, or civic initiatives, data is routinely used to understand problems, inform decisions, and evaluate outcomes. Yet valuable insights often fail to influence action because they are not communicated clearly or compellingly. This session introduces storytelling with data as a structured approach to converting analysis into coherent visual arguments that resonate with specific audiences.

The workshop engages with three key themes: narrative framing, visualization choice, and clarity in communication. Rather than treating visualization as a purely technical skill, the workshop positions itself within broader conversations in data visualization for presenting compelling stories. At the end of the workshop, the participants will be able to frame and select visualization and design clear, audience-oriented data stories.

Structure and Design

The workshop is organised into three progressive segments.

1. Framing the Story (45 minutes)
The workshop will begin with a discussion on what entails storytelling with data. Through discussions and illustrative examples, the participants will learn about purpose, and desired takeaway from storytelling. 

2. Developing a storyboard (60 minutes): 
Using a given data source, participants model raw data into a storyboard, moving from question to structured narrative. 

3. Choosing the Visual Form (75 minutes)
This segment focuses on selecting appropriate visualization techniques for numerical data. Instead of surveying many tools, we examine decision logic: comparison, trend, distribution, or relationship? Participants work with a provided dataset to identify a central message and design one visualization that best communicates it. They write a two-sentence narrative explaining the insight. A structured peer-critique exercise follows, encouraging reflection on clarity and audience alignment.


Interactive and Engaging Elements

The workshop relies on collaborative hands-on exercises, peer critique, and discusison. Participants actively construct and revise a data story rather than passively observing demonstrations.

Intended Audience

Anyone interested in data visualization.


Learning Outcomes

By the end of the session, participants will learn to:

Understand storytelling with data
Select visualization types aligned with communicative purpose
Design clear, audience-oriented data stories



Why This Topic Matters to us

In our experience working with data and teaching others to use it, we often see strong analysis lose impact at the stage of communication. This workshop responds to that gap. Effective data storytelling strengthens arguments by making their logic, evidence, and implications visible and accessible. In a world saturated with information, the ability to communicate insight responsibly and persuasively is essential across fields and professions.

The numbers are the same for everyone. And yet, within minutes, you have five different interpretations, five different “obvious” next steps, and one familiar question floating around—“How are you seeing this?”

Because the real variable isn’t the data. It’s the lens.

How do you think when things are unclear? How do you solve problems when every option has trade-offs? How do you visualise data when it’s incomplete, noisy, or politically loaded? Most of us don’t realise we’re answering these questions on autopilot, using default thinking patterns that feel “logical” because they’re familiar.

That’s exactly what this Cognilense workshop is built for.

So, what exactly is Cognilense?
CogniLense is a practical thinking toolkit, built as card decks created from Siddharth Kabra’s experience across hundreds of design and business problems. It gives teams a simple, structured way to switch perspectives on purpose, instead of getting stuck in one dominant viewpoint. These are problem solving tools to think from various perspectives and arrive at a holistic solution.

Here's what the worskhop looks like:
- The session centers on one idea: if you change the lens, you change the interpretations, decisions and conclusions. 
- Participants will work in small groups of 5–6
- A scenario-based activity where information is introduced in “data chunks,” just like real life—partial, messy, and open to interpretation. 
- Each participant takes on a specific thinking lens (the CogniLense “hats”; for example: optimist, skeptic, crook, judgement, process)
- The group debates the same situation from different angles before aligning on a conclusion. 
- We close with a guided debrief and reflection to surface what changed, why it changed, and what participants noticed about their own default patterns of thinking and visualizing data.


Who is the audience for the workshop?
People who work with decisions-making and different scenarios - especially those in product, design, business, data, marketing, leadership, and collaborative roles; where outcomes improve when teams can consider multiple viewpoints (not just the loudest one). Even students, designers, or any professional in data viz.

What will participants take away?
Participants leave with:
- Awareness of their own thinking patterns and blind spots
- A repeatable method to interpret and communicate data through multiple lenses.
- Sharper awareness of bias patterns (individual and group)
- A stronger ability to align teams around decisions, especially when the data is real, but the meaning is contested.
- A stronger habit of conscious thinking and visualising data, instead of autopilot conclusions.",https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/150laDnca48-e2Z57lK5mLAcj9K1nrckoY9NlomdSzBg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/monsoonfish_cognilense-x-caizin-activity-7254737057011412993-GSuk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACB6Ve0BydlfOIaQTi6oFPoile2za0dBtlY,https://monsoonfish.com/cognilense/home/,"Projector and screen set-up, mic & speaker, paper and pen for each participant to scribble their perspectives.",A room with a projector.,Keep,Under Review

Participants will get to use our tools (the GTFS data finder, route diagram generator, and the design system) to create maps for their own bus stop(s).

Most of the work we do at Bengawalk is about making the city of Bengaluru more accessible with design, tech and storytelling. Through this workshop, we want people to be part of this journey by making bus maps and testing our design system. The goal isn't just to visualize data but also understand how it shapes the way people navigate public systems.

Outcome:
At the end of the workshop, everyone will have created 1-2 bus stop maps!

The structure of the workshop is as follows:
30min - Introduction & Presentation
2hr - Workshop 
1hr - Lunch Break
1hr - Review and Q&A

The activities planned are:
1. Using GTFS to filter and categorise the bus routes from your bus stop.
2. Using our route diagram generator to get a base drawing of the route map.
3. Using Figma to tweak the design, refine hierarchy, labels, legibility etc to make it usable.
4. Review session to see everyone's maps side-by-side.
5. Reflections and Q&A
Of course, we will give demos and guidance at every step.

How it relates to conversations in data viz, especially for community: 
This workshop connects to larger data viz conversations around public infrastructure, open data, usability, and human-centered systems. Public transport data is rarely accessible. Raw GTFS feeds are complex, and without filtering, categorisation, and design, they remain a mystery to commuters. Data visualization is essential for civic design: how can we convert data into clear, legible visual systems that directly impact mobility?

Intended Audience

This talk begins with a simple belief:
we all repeat things.

We take familiar routes.
We postpone some tasks.
We call certain people more often than others.
We start routines, pause them, and return to them.
We move through news, moods, and environments every single day.

Sometimes we write these down. But after a while, those notes sit quietly, and we rarely return to them in a way that teaches us something.

So my question is simple:

We write about our lives. But what if we could see them?
Would that change our choices?
Would it help us understand who we are becoming?

In this talk, I will show how ordinary everyday moments can grow into visualizations that reveal who we are and how we move through the world.

I’ll share projects built from my own routines. For instance, I will talk about how documenting my metro commute helped me notice crowd rhythms and predictability. I will also share how mapping a BMRTC bus ride helped reveal who occupies space and how that shifts during the journey.

These did not begin with large or complex datasets.
They began with noticing and observing.

The talk will unpack my process:

- how I decide what is worth tracking.
- how I build discipline in data collection.
- what begins to change as days and weeks accumulate.
- how different visual approaches highlight different truths.

Along the way, I will show early attempts, iterations, mistakes, and the unexpected insights that only appeared after reflection from the visualization.

The intention is to make this practice feel accessible.
Not heavy.
Not technical.
Something anyone can begin.

This session is for anyone curious about patterns in their own life ~ design students, data practitioners, researchers, developers, and also people who may not work with data professionally but enjoy tracking habits, keeping logs, or reflecting on how their days unfold.

By the end of the session, people will start looking at everyday life a little differently.

They’ll notice that the small things they usually ignore ~ the routes they repeat, the delays, the pauses, the habits ~ are quietly telling stories about them.

They will see how turning these moments into visuals can help them spot patterns in their behaviour, become more aware of the environments they move through, reflect honestly on their choices, and understand how others experience the same situations.

They’ll leave with,

- Simple ways to begin their own tracking practices, 
- Approaches for translating logs into visuals, and most importantly,
- The reassurance that you don’t need big data or intimidating tools to discover something meaningful.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/nomeshwarireddy-84a288188/recent-activity/all/,,,"Yes, only once",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Creating charts with data is often a frustrating process when using traditional design tools. It typically involves exporting data to external charting libraries, restructuring spreadsheets in Excel, and spending hours pushing pixels - only to find that the result still isn’t quite right, just to repeat this process each time the data changes. And if you ever wanted to do something more custom, you quickly realise that you are fighting an uphill battle.

This is why I wanted to propose building charts and iterating in code. To most, this sounds like the lofty goal of learning D3.js. However the immediate stumbling block when starting to learn D3 is realising that it isn’t just a single tool they need to pick up -  it's a whole ecosystem of tools including HTML,CSS, JavaScript and then finally the D3 API. Courses on D3 essentially require that you become a full-fledged web developer before you even touch your first chart.

Over the years, I’ve learned that if you just wanted to start creating with data, this is all a bit overkill. The value in learning D3 isn’t in memorising its expansive API or mastering web development, but rather in understanding how to break down complex charts into simple shapes ( lines, circles, rectangles) and then map rows of data to draw these shapes on a screen.

Which is why, in this workshop, we’ll treat D3 as a helper tool, letting it handle the trickier parts like math and layout while we focus on building charts with a framework like Svelte. We’ll also break down complex charts into simple steps, and learn which sections can be supported by LLMs / online examples, and which parts benefit most from your own hands-on creative process.


### Flow of the workshop
The workshop would be a hands-on experience driven by simplified examples. We would cover just enough theory to get started with drawing with data. This would include basic HTML to draw SVGs and shapes inside it, minimal CSS and JavaScript where we will use D3 to prep the data for display.

While examples will include basic charts initially like bar charts and scatter plots, I would like to transition what we have learned to simplified versions of custom charts along the lines of the work of Federica Fragapane in [Renewables in Europe](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4afwEntKo-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), [Periodic Table](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwRqQh7FCqY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), etc.


### Takeaways
- Participants would get a sense of how to approach dataviz with code, going from idea to a working prototype
- Hands-on experience with creating custom charts in D3 that would otherwise be difficult without code
- Participants will gain a high-level understanding of web development through creating charts, with an introduction to HTML, minimal CSS, and a main focus on JavaScript - just enough to get started with building charts

The talk focuses on the design, development, and deployment of the eSankhyiki Portal, the NSO India’s unified digital platform that brings together more than 700 datasets and 136 million records from MoSPI other data-producing Ministries and Departments of the Government of India into a single, accessible interface.
The central idea of the talk is that visualization is not merely a presentation layer but a core part of the data lifecycle, from discovery and validation to interpretation and policy action. Through eSankhyiki, visualization becomes embedded within everyday workflows for policymakers, researchers, journalists, and citizens. The talk will demonstrate how thematic dashboards, interactive charts, filtering tools, and metadata-driven interfaces help users move from broad questions to specific insights while working with complex socio-economic data.
This topic matters deeply to me because of my long engagement with modernizing official statistics and making them more usable for diverse audiences. In public sector environments, visualization must operate under constraints of scale, data sensitivity, standards, and long-term sustainability. Building eSankhyiki required balancing technical robustness with clarity, accessibility, and trust which are the values that are fundamental to responsible data visualization.
The talk connects directly to ongoing conversations in the data visualization community around usability, accessibility, ethical representation, and visualization for public good. I will discuss how design choices were informed by user research, accessibility considerations, and the need for transparency through clear metadata and explanatory notes. I will also touch on the role of AI-enabled semantic search and how it complements visualization by improving data discovery.
The presentation will follow a clear narrative flow, beginning with the scale and complexity of India’s official statistics and the need for a unified dissemination platform, followed by a discussion of user needs and how they shaped visualization design. I will then walk through key features of eSankhyiki with concrete use cases, examine governance and regulatory constraints, and conclude with lessons learned and future directions for visualization in official statistics.
The intended audience includes data visualization practitioners, civic technologists, designers, policymakers, journalists, and researchers interested in applied visualization and public-interest data systems. Participants will leave with practical strategies for building visualization systems at scale, insights into designing for trust and usability, and a clearer understanding of how visualization can meaningfully shape real-world decisions inside large institutions.",https://esankhyiki.mospi.gov.in/,,,I have never given a talk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Visualization works well when it is anchored in business and implementation context: what problem you’re solving, what action you’re enabling, or what understanding you’re trying to build.

And honestly, I’ve seen this happen in almost every team at some point, even strong teams. You’re under pressure, you have data, and you feel like the next logical step is to visualize it. But over the years, across projects, products, and business problems I’ve learnt that this is usually how you end up with data that look great but don’t help anyone make a decision.

Purpose first, charts later. 
Visualization should start with intent, not with available data.
The chain: wisdom → knowledge → data → visualization.

First define what you’re trying to understand (wisdom), then what you need to know (knowledge), then what data supports it, and only then design the visual.

Visualization is a decision tool. 
A good data viz reduces ambiguity and makes the next step obvious (thresholds, alerts, ownership, drill-downs).
Match the visual to the job. Different formats serve different needs, seeing direction, prioritizing, spotting issues early, or explaining drivers.

This approach comes from years of building products and solving business problems where “pretty dashboards” often failed because nobody knew what to do with them. 
The talk shares the practical lessons learned from real work, what consistently makes visualizations useful, and what makes them ignored.

Because visualization is never the end goal. It’s a tool with a purpose. And most of the time that purpose is one of three things: solve a problem, enable an action, or build understanding. 

If you don’t know which of these you’re doing, you’ll end up visualizing everything and still not know what to do next.

How it connects to conversations in data visualization:
A lot of data viz conversations focus on chart types, tools, aesthetics, or storytelling. This talk adds a complementary angle: data viz as product design and leadership craft where success is measured by decision quality, action clarity, and business outcomes, not by visual polish alone.

Talk overview:
1. Why “data → chart” is the most common trap
2. The wisdom → knowledge → data → visualization chain
3. Method: A repeatable checklist for purpose-first visualization
4. Examples: How the same thinking applies across different contexts (ecosystems, products, operations, experience design)
5. Close: A simple principle to remember + what to do differently starting tomorrow

Who is this relevant to:
People working in products where multiple stakeholders rely on data to act.
Product leaders, founders, design leaders, data teams, analysts, and anyone responsible for dashboards, reporting, or decision-making systems especially people working in products where multiple stakeholders rely on data to act.

Key takeaways
A clear way to define *why* a visualization exists before designing it
A repeatable framework to move from business context to the right data and the right visual
Practical guidance on making data actionable (not just informative)
A mindset shift: don’t visualize data, visualize decisions

So the big idea is simple, and it’s something I’ve come to believe because I’ve seen it play out repeatedly: Don’t visualize data.

It tries to answer this through modules that get people to discuss, debate, and disseminate! Each session involves activities, games, and reflections about sex, bodies, gender, and education. 
We live in a world where all the information we could possibly need about sex education is right at our fingertips, yet somehow, we still struggle to have conversations about our bodies. The consequence of this stigma around talking about sex manifests itself in the different ways we normalise abuse in our daily lives. From catcalling on the streets, to slut-shaming at home, and even harassment in the workplace, we’ve created room in our realities for our minds and bodies to be constantly violated, because we’ve convinced ourselves that it’s easier to ignore, than to acknowledge and have conversations. Could talking about sex, sexuality, our bodies and gender more, lead to positive change? 
The project currently exists as 2 modules – “Media, Misogyny, and Me” and “The Large Language Module”, which explore the how our opinions and biases around sex and gender are shaped by media and language respectively. The links below are 1. For the project itself – a detailed repository of stories I’ve been collecting through these modules and a mapping of how these stories are connected; 2. The downloadable for the Media Module which includes instructions for each activity and the printables required; and 3. The downloadable for the Language module in that order. 
The modules have been designed with the following framework:
1.	An icebreaker based either on recollecting a memory or asking for an opinion. This activity needs to happen off the top of someone’s head, it’s the hook to get them invested in the rest of the session.
2.	A discussion prompt that establishes the main question(s) of the session. 
3.	Shared Experiences is a game that’s all about establishing common ground for all the participants by recollecting universal experiences. The discussion here is centred around WHY these experiences are so universal. 
4.	The Main Activity facilitates the brunt of the connection-making. A reflective activity that is focussed on pattern recognition and connection-building. This is the “diagnosis” part of the session, where we try to find the root of these opinions and ideas.
5.	The second discussion prompt is focussed on ensuring the connection between the first experiences covered up until the last activity, which will be somewhat removed from personal opinions and will be focussed on larger observations, making participants ponder about how small-scale decisions can have large-scale effects.
6.	And finally, a speculative drawing activity. This activity is future-focussed, with the goal of leaving a lingering image in the participants minds - either of fear or hope, depending on how your discussions go.

In practice, there are no clean maps. Every map is a negotiation between data sources, definitions, and vintages. Maps are not neutral mirrors of reality; they are reconciliations built on trade-offs and hard decisions.

This talk explores what it means to build spatial analysis when underlying geographies do not align across time, hierarchy, or definition.

Drawing from my work with village-level, pincode-level, hex-level, and district-level data, I unpack the analytical decisions required when:

1) Administrative hierarchies don’t align across time
Village shapefiles from 2011 coexIst with district boundaries updated in 2022. The hierarchy is conceptually nested but spatially inconsistent. What assumptions are embedded when we visualise one inside the other? How do these mismatches affect interpretation?

2) Parallel geographies coexist.
Districts and pincodes are both valid units, yet neither nests cleanly within the other. When users need insights at both levels, we are forced to construct relationships that do not naturally exist.

3) Granularity must be constructed
Data rarely comes at the level we need. To make it usable, we’ve had to create new spatial units to cover gaps, estimating population at village and pincode levels, and combining multiple sources to produce consistent analytical layers.

4) Spatial logics conflict
Datasets such as WorldPop operate on raster grids, while other datasets may rely on hex-based systems like Kontur’s hexes. Merging grids and hexes means translating between fundamentally different spatial assumptions about area, density, and aggregation.

5) Geographic provenance is unknown
Survey data often arrives at the district level without clarity on which boundary definitions were used. When boundaries evolve, a “district” is not a stable object. How do we responsibly visualise such data when the shapefile itself is uncertain?

Across these cases, mapping is not just a visual exercise but a series of analytical trade-offs. It requires deliberate choices about boundaries, aggregation, approximation, and how much uncertainty we are willing to carry forward.

Rather than presenting a single solution, this session argues that spatial visualisation begins long before design; in the invisible work of reconciling geographies. The question is not whether trade-offs exist, but whether we acknowledge and communicate them.

As a reporter for a magazine, I have extensively used QGIS to report on news stories. The workshop is designed for any interested participant to get started with maps and cartography on QGIS. But, we are not going to ‘just use’ the tool – we are going to map how uneven is the social infrastructure distribution of Bengaluru – is one neighbourhood hogging most of the green shade in the city? Does Devara Jeevanahalli have any schools? How many police stations does Bengaluru have and more importantly where are they located?

It expands on the ideas we are putting forward around how teams can think about making sense of qualitative data coming in from various sources, and how one goes from disparate quotes, transcripts, NPS feedback to answers and insights to important questions. It is targeted towards those who work in teams to help structure, analyse and present insights from various datasets especially for internal team decision making. 

The workshop would unfold in 3 parts:
1/  Initial introduction to the ideas in the talk so that everyone has a shared understanding and there’s time for resolving doubts, understanding any specific experiences to assimilate into the workshop design & flow

2/ Analog exploration of qualitative data
- We would present the case study, along with the decision that the company is trying to make
- We would then share bite-sized versions of the synthetic data in physical forms (exact formats to be decided), and setup the more detailed questions the company needs to answer using the data. 
- The participants would then have some time to go through the datasets, and pull out the data, both qualitative and quantitative, to gain insight and put forward recommendations for the decisions 
- Most importantly, we will explore how they can put forward their ideas with the backing of quotes, and patterns from the datasets 

3/ Digital Exploration
- We would then onboard the participants onto a version of the Dots platform that is already setup with the various datasets 
- The groups would then use the platform to work with a much more expanded dataset, and use various systems to filter and analyze the data along relevant variables and attributes

Learning outcomes:
+ Learn how insights emerge when qualitative data is structured across sources, variables, and attributes
+ Experience the difference between anecdotal reasoning and evidence-backed conclusions
+ Practice tracing insights back to supporting quotes, patterns, and datasets
+ Gain a transferable mental model for synthesising qualitative information into decision-grade insight
+ See how visual and structural organisation of data enables sense-making, not just summarisation

Rather than a presentation, the goal is to create a space where participants can compare real experiences of how insights actually travel — or fail to travel — into decisions.

Many teams today collect large amounts of qualitative information: interviews, support conversations, NPS comments, usability tests, field observations, and internal feedback. However, across product and program teams, a common pattern appears: research exists, but decisions are still driven by intuition, hierarchy, or dashboards. This dialogue invites participants to collectively examine why that happens.

We will guide the discussion through a set of prompts, encouraging participants to share practices, frustrations, and workarounds from their own organisations. The facilitators will not present solutions; instead we will help surface patterns across roles, sectors, and team structures.

Areas we want to cover:
- How qualitative data is gathered: What kind of qualitative data is gathered, who actually does it, how is this data managed
- How decisions are actually made: how does quant talk to qual, at what points does qual become absolutely necessary, how is the information analysed, how is it presented
- How have team structures + processes changed with the influx of AI: what actual changes have happened in workflows because of AI tools? Real change or a lot of Linkedin theater? 

Intended Outcome: 
Participants leave with a clearer understanding of how different teams handle qualitative knowledge, a shared language to describe internal challenges, and practical ideas drawn from peer experience. The session emphasises collective learning and reflection rather than instruction.

The reception was quite good, and I think we piqued everyone’s curiosity, and perhaps exploration. This year our talk addresses the next question: what does it actually mean to operationalise qualitative data so that it influences real decisions?
This year we would also focus the presentation through the lens of product companies such as D2C, digital consumer applications, so that it is more relatable to the Vizchitra audience. We want to be able to speak to those who have to support decision making using data, looking at how data is analysed, and how the insights are expressed to enable swift, and sure decisionmaking. 

The core idea of this talk is that qualitative data become really useful when we can look at various sources of data, and then analyse them structurally rather than only narratively. Product analytics platforms already do this with behavioural data: they construct cohorts, segment users by shared attributes, and examine patterns across variables. We argue that qualitative information can be analysed similarly — not by reducing it to numbers, but by organising it so patterns, relationships, and evidence chains become visible. 
To make this concrete, the talk will use a synthetic case study. We would introduce a fictional product company attempting to answer a realistic question about user satisfaction and retention. We will share a journey using combined datasets: NPS responses with written feedback alongside excerpts from research calls. We’ll use this case study to show how with these sources of data, and structuring using meta data and attributes can lead to useful insights that can drive decisions. 

This topic matters to us because we think that this is a glaring blindspot for many teams. And with the swift adoption of consumer AI tools people are dumping qualitative data into chat windows, expecting deep insights when all they’re going to get are summaries.

We refine visual hierarchies, optimise legibility, and ensure statistical integrity. Yet the narrative spine that determines what an audience ultimately understands is often left implicit.

When a story is not intentionally shaped or when there are gaps in its structure, the human brain goes into autopilot. It fills those gaps on its own. The result is simple. The message taken away is not necessarily the message that was presented.

This workshop introduces the idea of a Minimum Viable Story, the most basic narrative structure required to avoid a message being diluted or misinterpreted. Rather than treating storytelling as embellishment, the session positions narrative as a structural responsibility. Just as visual contrast makes data legible, story structure ensures insight is understood.

At the centre of this approach is the core insight. Before design decisions are made, before sequencing is finalised, before aesthetics are refined, one question must be answered clearly: What is the non-negotiable idea that must be understood? From that anchor point, the narrative can be reverse engineered by priming the audience to receive the insight and organising information in a way that supports it rather than competes with it.

Participants will work with shared material and reshape it around a clearly defined insight, observing how structural choices influence interpretation. The emphasis is not on making information entertaining, but on ensuring that it is understood as intended.

This workshop centres on foundational narrative structure. It may be less useful for practitioners who already employ established storytelling frameworks or who are deliberately experimenting with unconventional narrative forms. It is particularly suited to those whose primary focus lies in data analysis, craft, or visual design, and who are looking for a clear structural approach to presenting their work so that their intended insight is understood.

Designed for data designers, information designers, journalists, and visual communicators working with complexity, this workshop reframes narrative not as decoration, but as cognitive infrastructure.

This project is deeply personal, as my own life trajectory has been inextricably intertwined with the migratory experiences of my family and community. Growing up in Bihar, I witnessed firsthand the economic imperatives that compelled countless individuals to leave their homes in search of better opportunities. My subsequent migration for education and career further solidified my understanding of the challenges and aspirations of those who traverse these geographical and emotional landscapes. This connection and passion became more stringer during the COVID-19 pandemic, where several workers were forced to migrate back to their roots, with heavy repercussion.

I envision a multidisciplinary project that combines performance, visual art, data visualization and sound to create a powerful and immersive experience. The collected narratives and objects will serve as the raw material for developing a script that weaves together personal stories and broader social commentary. 

There will be 2 parts to a single performance - One being a physical performance of me creating movements showing the patterns and effect of migration, and second being the project of my movement in the form of visual art being generated on a plain wall for people to witness it.

Or, perhaps, wondering if your local police station is effective? Or, maybe if all those election promises of cracking down on drugs, land/sand/alcohol mafia, and post-election action on comedians and “anti-nationals” have gone anywhere? 

In this talk, I'll run through on how one can digitally investigate cases by triangulating data from publicly-available court, police and media documents. This approach can be used to build robust datasets on virtually any criminal act in the country. No coding required and no fancy tech (okay, perhaps, a little optional use of LLMs at the end). It's an intentionally low-tech approach that allows one to develop datasets that can be used to analyse patterns or narrate compelling stories on how the State uses or misuses the power of the law. 

The creation of the dataset can be broken into two: discovery of cases; and its analysis. 

The core of the dataset is the FIR number. I'll run through some ways sneaky and not-so-sneaky ways to discover cases. This includes using RTIs with the police, trawling through e-courts for bail and other court orders, or finding FIR numbers through media articles or social media posts to find criminal and legal information. 

Once, you ""discover"" cases, I'll show a few ways in which one can build the dataset (here, is where a LLM may help), and how to find patterns and narrate these stories. 

I've spent a few years learning from previous datasets, while tinkering with ways to build larger datasets (and to build them quickly without the need for a team or coding). This talk is not about replication, but rather to serve as inspiration. The hope is that the audience will start tinkering with e-courts, police websites and media sites to build their own legal data sets for reporting, story-telling, accountability or to understand the shadowy world of police, courts and law.

Problem
Scientists and engineers in India often struggle to create visuals for their research papers that clearly communicate their ideas. One major reason is that most design and illustration tools are not built for science or for scientists. As a result, researchers spend weeks or even months trying to make figures and plots. Many end up publishing visuals that do not do justice to their hard work or the quality of their research. We are working to change this.
Outline
-A live demo of creating a highly detailed 3D illustration of drug delivery to cancer tissue in under one minute using Labcanvas.io. Which would take at least 3 to 8  hours in tools like Blender for an expert. This does not rely on AI image generation or ready made templates, but on structured generators.
-How building a community of scientific illustrators scicommtalent.com  helped scientists find and hire illustrators who truly understand their research
-How we can use Google AI Studio to rig SVG illustrations which scientists can customize without drawing. This  solved decades old problem in illustration tools ‘customizability’. This workflow is unique and something we developed ourselves.
-AI image generation is not the future in science visualization but generators are.
-What building free resources and tools for science visualization like moldraw.com, openscienceart.com, planticons.com, posterscientist.com, mapmypaper.com helped me learn about building solutions for dataviz.. How you also can build tools and resources even without coding skills with minimal cost.

While menstruation is discussed more openly now, the conversation often stays “safe”, relying on clean awareness campaigns and brand-friendly metaphors that avoid the real, messy texture of lived experience.

Meanwhile, the cost of silence keeps showing up in bodies, labour, and the spaces we live in. Policy may shift in parts of the formal world, but lived reality remains uneven, especially in informal work, where “missing a day” can mean fines, debt, or extreme measures taken just to keep earning.
We are two designers collecting fragments - language, rituals, labour, stories, myths, visuals around periods. 

We want to place these fragments in shared spaces for discussion and move past ""opinion exchange"" to look at the humor, contradictions, and costs of the silence we all navigate.

1.  Our Central Question is:

How do code words, slang, and unspoken rules shape how menstruation is understood and managed in everyday life, and what changes when we put these fragments together in the open? What changes when these private systems become visible as shared data?

2.  Who we want in the room:

People across ages, backgrounds, and work contexts (including informal work), plus designers/storytellers/researchers interested in how language and visuals shape reality. This session welcomes women, trans and non-binary menstruators.

3.  The Data & Visual Foundation:

This dialogue is anchored in our ongoing primary research, which has gathered 250+ responses through in-person interviews and digital surveys. This dataset captures a rich spectrum of experiences, including:

⤷ Context & Identity: How menstruation is managed across different labor conditions and environments.
⤷ The Language of Silence: A collection of period code words (English + local languages).
⤷ Physical & Emotional Markers: ""Period fits,"" body signals, rituals, and comfort foods.

4.  Dialogue Structure: 
(This is still a work in progress and we’d appreciate any guidance to figure this out further)

 ⤷ Introduction: 
Start with 3-5 questions like ‘Write the first word you were taught to use instead of ‘period.’ to start the conversation 

⤷ Discuss/dialogue/converse: 
Bring the language, the blood, and the rules into the open: reading slang, data, and lived accounts aloud and mapping the effort of hiding them, so menstruation appears in the room as it is: ordinary, material, and socially managed.

5.   What can they take away:
⤷ a shared vocabulary map of code words + what we “buy” (privacy/safety) 
⤷ a simple “period labour scorecard” that helps someone locate where period-related effort comes from (space + rule + cost) and score it 1–5.
⤷ a prototype of an “honest period visual language” moodboard / icon system (with do/don’t rules decided by the women, for the women)

6.   How we will visualize this for engagement:
Live Mapping: We will facilitate a live, physical visualization where participants can ""plot"" their own experiences using threads/stickers against the data visualization of the 250+ responses we’ve collected.

2. Sticky notes / markers / thread or stickers for live mapping and adding responses next it.
