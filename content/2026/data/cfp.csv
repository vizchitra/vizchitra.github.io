[a] place achieves concrete reality when our experience of it is total, that is through all the senses”. Our personal memories of a place are situated in fleeting sensory experiences – the waft of the petrichor, bird songs scoring the background, bakery aromas, sounds of traffic and footfalls whizzing by. This interplay between our senses structures and mediates our sense of a place. However, traditional mapping practices — deriving their methods from scientific paradigms — view maps as objective and immutable artefacts to measure and notate the world. These provide limited guidance for observing, collecting and representing such subjective, qualitative data. 

Map-making has a long history of development, where methods for recording and representing geographical information have been refined over centuries (Abrams and Hall, 2008). In recent years, there has been a rise in humanistic approaches to data visualisation, and cartography is now primed for a similar expansion of perspectives. 

My talk centers on data experiences that highlight the rich, interconnected web of sensory information underlying our everyday encounters.

Common gender factors such as labor force participation, income, growth, and financial inclusion are often presented as merely facts. However, the mathematical and methodological choices behind these numbers: the averages and categorizations often influence whose experiences will be shown and whose will remain hidden in sight.

The core idea of this talk is that economics and mathematics work as narrative tools in public media than being just jargonized technical tools. When gender is treated as a thought for later, stories risk reinforcing systematic invisibility rather than challenging inequality. By examining how data is presented, this talk asks how public media can represent economic realities more inclusively.

This topic matters to me because my work lies at the intersection of economics, mathematics, and researched-based public writing, with special focus on gender, culture and social structures. Through researching for articles and writing about social factors, I have repeatedly encountered gaps between lived gendered experiences and the way economic data is presented in media, public and policy debates. This talk grows out of that tension and goes all the way towards connecting directly to conversations in data visualization around ethics, representation, and accessibility in writing and policy contexts. It also focuses on the responsibility of data practitioners to question dominant visual factors rather than reproducing them without critically thinking about them.

The talk will follow a clear structure: first, outlining how economic data is commonly visualized in public media. Second, it will examine how specific mathematical and data choices flatten gendered labor and care work. Third, it will be analyzing examples where visualization either conceals or reveals inequality and lastly, it will offer practical solutions through frameworks that will integrate gender into economic data stories.

The intended audience includes students, media people, writers researchers, analysts, and practitioners working with socio-economic and mathematical data.

Recently I worked with BMTC, WRI India and Villgro at Bengawalk to redesign the 20-year-old maps at Bengaluru's most iconic bus station, Majestic. Majestic, the heart of the city's transit system, has 300+ bus routes, 36 platforms, a railway station, and now a metro interchange. With over 3-4 lakh daily visitors, clear navigation is essential. This talk is about the process that goes into making such data accessible: categorisation and filtering of public data, working out the design system based on user research and feedback, and working with the government to help them see the value of good design for cities. 

The core ideas of this talk:
1. The process behind map-making for citizens: user research and site analysis, data, design and implementation
2. India needs to invest in user-centric design to transform its cities
3. We can start small and think big— governments can invest in pilot projects in key areas before scaling to the broader city

Why is data visualisation so important for public design?
Most of the work we do at Bengawalk is about making the city of Bengaluru more accessible with design, tech and storytelling. Getting to do the data visualisation of public data —BMTC routes at Majestic Bus Station— was important because:
1. It makes the complex clear: people are now able to skim 150+ routes in seconds. Also, relationships between platforms and their directionalities in the city emerged for the first time, to the delight of both city nerds and regular commuters alike. 
2. It puts us in the minds of the people: it pushed us to analyse and understand how people actually navigate, instead of designing in a vacuum. This can be especially useful for government officials to experience in order to serve the people. 
3. It feels good: good design that helps you find your way can reduce unnecessary confusion and frustration. Also, it makes the space more pleasant and transparent. 
These are things that the people of any city deserve. 

The main sections and flow of the presentation:
1. The difference good wayfinding & signage can make
2. The process behind making the maps for BMTC Majestic: 
			2.1 user research and site analysis
			2.2 categorising and filtering public data
			2.3 working out the design system
			2.4 public feedback, stakeholder feedback, and multiple iterations

I want to re-introduce maps where they assign equal visual space to each state.

I want people to explore how creating and using alternative map designs, they can challenge some visual biases that they may unknowingly hold. By giving each state equal visual weight, I am challenging the viewer to engage with the underlying data rather than subconsciously ignoring trends in smaller states, particularly the NE region.

This matters to me because states which perform really well in a policy arena get left out when they are visualized by performance. When this data, such as school enrollment rates, or health outcomes are mapped using traditional maps, there are some times when small states don't get the attention they deserve- their success stories can disappear in plain sight.

The talk will be structured in 4 parts. 

First I will visually unpack the bias we hold, I'll do this by showing important data and how small states end up in our blind spots.

Next, I will talk about how I approached this problem. Why I chose Hexagons, How I assigned them positions on an imaginary grid. Walk them through the construction process, which is largely non-digital, and the trade-offs I had to make between geography and design. This process was very manual and hands on and involved cutting physical hexagons and lots of trial and error.

Next, I will talk about creating a python function and turning it into a streamlit website to encode these into a visualization and how one can patch data to this function to create their own maps.

Finally, I will end with examples and cases where this map could be preferred over the traditional one and also when it probably won't be the best choice to visualize state data.

The intended audience for this project are likely college-going data enthusiasts who are looking to expand how they can viz tools which are relevant, and how they can turn simple visualization functions into easy-to-use websites.

Large-scale enterprise environments, with their diverse workflows, data requirements, and design standards, highlight the need for a robust approach. This talk will explore how to build composable React chart components that serve as the foundation of scalable visualization systems, enabling teams to deliver interactive, customizable, and performant charts while maintaining cohesion, reducing duplication, and embedding accessibility from the ground up.

React provides the perfect foundation for composable chart components. By leveraging its component architecture, props, and hooks, developers can create modular, reusable, and adaptable charts that are platform aware and easy to extend. Accessibility through keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA-compliant elements should be baked in from the start, ensuring all users can interact with and understand the data. This approach allows teams to balance flexibility, consistency, and inclusivity, turning charts from isolated components into a coherent, scalable system.

The talk will demonstrate how to put these principles into practice. It will cover patterns for composable components, API design conventions, and strategies for reuse, along with approaches for customization and overrides that allow product-specific adaptations without breaking platform-wide consistency. Accessibility will be highlighted as a first-class concern, showing how to design charts that work for everyone without costly retrofits. Finally, the session will address scalability, performance, and long-term maintainability, illustrating how a React-based charting system can evolve to support multiple products, large datasets, and complex interactions over time.

This topic matters because building visualizations at scale is as much about engineering a system as it is about displaying data. Composable, reusable charts let teams respond quickly to new requirements, reduce duplication, and maintain consistency across products or platforms. When accessibility is built in from the start, these charts work for everyone, helping teams minimize technical debt, collaborate effectively, and evolve their visualization layer alongside the products it supports.

The intended audience includes front-end and visualization engineers, UI/UX designers, and technical product leads who work on platform-level products or large-scale analytics systems. By the end of the session, attendees will understand why composable, accessible chart patterns are critical for scalable platforms, how to design charts that balance flexibility and consistency, and practical strategies for implementing a maintainable, extensible, and inclusive visualization system.

The tooling has exploded with drag-and-drop builders, low-code platforms, ChatGPTs this, LLMs, chart libraries for everyone and their mothers, templates for every use case and all flavors of agentic coding. The time is ripe. Government departments, NGOs, and civic tech projects: everyone can ship a public data dashboard now, and everyone does. On the surface, this looks like progress. More data is being published. More interfaces exist. Accessibility is improving. The hammers have found their nails.

I think public data dashboards should be infrastructure, not publications. Many dashboards get built, launched, and maybe written about, but then they sit there, waiting for the next person to come along and build the same thing again. They look helpful with their filters, charts, maps, and download buttons. However, try to put them through their paces and the complexity turns out to be quite shallow. I don't think the problem is technical skill or bad intentions. I'd argue it's inherited assumptions. These are ideas about what a dashboard should be that we absorbed from enterprise BI tools and never questioned for public contexts. We assume that if the data is there, it's accessible. Please don't question it anymore. Can't you see the Big Ass Number? The Donut? The Bars? What more do you want, really?

Meanwhile, what we can build has changed. Not just technically, although browsers and tooling have capabilities that aren't being used nearly enough. It is a change in the possibilities and expectations of how we think about public data interfaces altogether. This talk is a discussion about that gap; between the dashboards we keep building and the public data infrastructure we need. Looking at what's working and what isn't across interfaces, from national portals to scrappy civic tech projects, and drawing on experiments at [Diagram Chasing](https://diagramchasing.fun), I'll walk through: 

1. A critique of the current landscape of public infrastructure dashboards. 
2. What I think are design assumptions worth questioning specifically for this context. 
3. Showcase some of the new technical possibilities worth exploring. The FOSS ecosystem is better than ever. DuckDB WASM, PMTiles, MapLibre, webR, parquets in the browser, and so much more! What can be the new mental model of how to build public dashboards that cost $0 to host but are often better than enterprise tools? 
4. What I think are some tiny (but big!) decisions that shape whether a data interface serves people the way it wants to.

This session is for designers, civic technologists, developers, open-data enthusiasts, and anyone who builds public data interfaces or indeed, decides what gets built.

Grant programs publish where the money went. But can we quantify if it reached the problems that mattered most? This talk shows how we visualised $1M+ in community-driven funding for open-source software: not as a list of funded projects, but as capital flows from ecosystem challenges to the work that addresses them. This work engages questions about visualising complex allocation systems for designing feedback loops between community signals and strategic priorities. 

**Core ideas and context**

Most grant programs show you transactions: who received how much. That's transparency of allocation, not strategic clarity. In crowdfunding, the harder question is whether the aggregate of thousands of funding decisions actually maps to the priorities an ecosystem cares about.

We worked with a crowdfunding mechanism (Quadratic Funding) where donors collectively decide which open-source projects receive matching funds. It's radically transparent, where every donation and matching calculation is public. But transparency alone doesn't answer: 

> Are the most critical problems getting funded, or just the most visible ones?

Community funding has a structural bias. Work that's narratable, immediately useful, and easy to explain attracts donations. Ecosystem critical work that's long-horizon, coordination-heavy, or infrastructural struggles to compete for attention, even when donors intellectually agree it matters.

This data analysis bridged that gap. Starting from curated problem catalogues developed through domain sensemaking, including stakeholder interviews, ecosystem analysis, and expert judgment, we used AI-assisted methods to align each project to primary and secondary problem areas. The resulting visualisations traced funding flows from problem categories to individual projects, making it possible to ask: 

> Did the problems we identified as most critical actually attract the funding needed to solve them?

Rohit Malekar designs analytics systems that help blockchain-native communities translate messy grant data into clear, actionable insights to make better capital allocation decisions. He designs tools that reduce information asymmetry and make funding decisions more fair, transparent, and evidence-based for funders, donors, grant allocators, and domain experts. His work spans the grants ecosystem in  [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co), analytics with [Open Source Observer](http://opensource.observer), and climate impact initiatives with [Atlantis](http://atlantisp2p.com). He believes the best visualisations don’t just inform. They coordinate action. More at [rohitmalekar.in](http://rohitmalekar.in)

1. **Beyond Transparency** (3 min): What blockchain-native funding already solved and the strategic question it leaves open
2. **The Approach** (8 min): From problem catalogues to funding flows, a review of design choices, AI-assisted alignment, and visualisation trade-offs
3. **The Patterns** (4 min): What the visualisations revealed and a reusable framework for problem-level funding analysis

**Intended audience**

Practitioners designing visualisations for civic, nonprofit, or grant contexts—anyone building decision-support tools where users navigate unfamiliar domains under uncertainty.

**Key takeaways**

1. **A diagnostic question**: ""Does your dashboard show where money went, or whether it reached what mattered?"" offers a new lens for evaluating grant effectiveness.

2. **A mental model**: Position analysis as an invitation for inquiry, not a final judgment. Stakeholders are more likely to engage when they're co-investigators, not defendants.

3. **Design principle**: AI can handle the first-pass categorization at scale; humans refine and validate.

Instead, they drift into UX roles. This observation comes from years of hiring, mentoring, and working with designers across experience levels. 

The core idea of this talk is a reality check. I’ll explore why this drift happens, what skills from data visualization translate well into UX, and what gets lost along the way. I’ll challenge the assumption that data viz and UX are parallel, equally available career paths, and instead argue that data visualization often functions as a gateway skill rather than a long-term destination role in most product organizations.

The talk also looks forward. As AI tools increasingly automate visualization generation, chart selection, and interaction patterns, many traditional data visualization skills are becoming commoditized. Knowing which chart to use will matter less than knowing why it works, when it fails, and how to shape meaning, narrative, and clarity. In this future, designers will differentiate themselves not through tool mastery, but through taste, judgment, visual hierarchy, and the ability to frame data in context.

This topic matters deeply to me because I work at the intersection of design, data, and complex product systems, and I regularly engage with students and early-career designers who are trying to make sense of where data visualization fits in the real world. 

The talk is structured in three parts. First, a grounded look at career realities and patterns I’ve observed. Second, an exploration of the skills, traits, and mindsets that help data viz practitioners succeed and evolve, including curiosity, fast domain learning, and comfort with ambiguity. Third, a call to action for leaders and organizations on how to create more meaningful opportunities for data visualization designers beyond defaulting them into UX roles.

# Abstract

Despite overwhelming scientific evidence of the climate crisis, a massive gap remains between public knowledge and meaningful action. This phenomenon, often driven by the “Bystander Effect,” allows individuals to remain passive, assuming responsibility lies elsewhere.

This talk presents Carbon Block, a speculative design project that moves beyond traditional “positive reinforcement” (rewards/badges) to explore the power of negative motivators and physical inconvenience. By utilising “slow alarms”—data-driven inflatable sculptures—the project materialises abstract carbon metrics into physical obstacles.

We will walk through the design process—from analysing the psychology of procrastination to prototyping IoT-enabled soft-robotic systems—to demonstrate how design can transform invisible data into an unavoidable call for collective intervention.

## Project Background & Methodology

The project is rooted in a two-phase research process:

Phase I (The Setting): Identifying the urban middle class as the critical demographic for public dissent and analysing the “wicked problem” of a consumerist economy driven by perpetual growth.

Phase II (The Staging): Applying behavioural science to design. Using Cohen’s Tetrahedron (Environment, Technology, Economy, Culture) to map the factors shaping our world, the project identifies that humans are more likely to act when faced with the loss of comfort, time, or identity.

The Solution: The Carbon Block Sculpture

The core artefact consists of three components:
- A Chrome Armature: A rigid structure representing the fixed “Carbon Budget.”
- A Latex Inflatable: A balloon that expands in real-time based on the user’s consumption data.
- IoT Integration: An Arduino-based pneumatic system that pulls live consumption metrics and inflates the balloon.

When the balloon exceeds the volume of the armature, it creates visual and physical tension, signaling a “carbon overshoot” in a way that cannot be ignored or swiped away.",,,,I have never given a talk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

It contains a plethora of deities symbolysing ancient and rich spiritual lineages. Visitors in art galleries are often awestruck when they see a Thangka. Its intricate details contain a plethora of deities and stories. While the dense information arouses the visitor's curiosity, they get overwhelmed and lost as to what all this information signifies? How does the visitor unfurl these details and navigate through the portals of ancient knowledge?    The core idea of this talk is to demo the proposed solutions to the above questions.  If the Thangkas are represented on a digital ""canvas"", then creators can digitally annotate each iconography and story in a Thangka.
These digital annotations can be used as markers to link the details of the selected section and further categorisation and elaboration of the ancient spiritual lineages.
Each annotation ""bubble"" in a Thankga will contain the basic information of the icon eg. deity, event or story. The bubble will also contain links to:

1. The elaboration of the icon including links to purchase the artifact or browse through related artifacts.
2. The associated MindMap to categorise the icon in the appropriate Central Figure, Geographic Region, Religion or Lineage Affiliation, Period, Collection, Thematic Sets, Exhibition Appearances, Publication Appearances etc.

This topic connects to conversations in data viz by merging physical and digital mediums of communication through digitally annotated narratives. The overarching structure and design of the talk is based on the communication of Arts & Culture through digital mediums. The main sections and flow of the presentation are as follows:
1. Introduce the concept of Tibetan Thangkas - What, Where and How from a physical real world perspective.
2. Display the corpus of digital knowledge that is already available as textual web resources and that has been graphically organised into MindMaps.
3. Merge the physical and digital worlds into a coherent navigation to immerse the users into ancient spiritual knowledge.

The intended audience are:

1. Collectors of museums interested to navigate and purchase artifacts about Tibetan Buddhist spiritual lineages.
2. Scholars interested in researching Tibetan Buddhist history.
3. Visitors who would like to get initiated into the practice of Tibetan Buddhism.

The Ch(art) of Visualising Data with Vibe Coding,"Yes, many times","With large language models, coding has changed, and so has data visualisation. 

“The hottest new programming language is English”, says Andrej Karpathy, who coined the term vibe coding. Since 2025, interest in the term has surged globally (https://tinyurl.com/ykff2bua). Anywhere you look, charts, dashboard, infographics, microsites built through prompts and iteration show up.

For someone like me, who spent countless hours painstakingly building charts line by line in ggplot/R or discovering new libraries like cutecharts in Python, vibe coding was an exciting shift. It took away most of the manual labour of writing code, allowed me to experiment with D3.js and other interactive chart libraries with low effort. Most of all, it massively cut the time taken from idea to implementation. Now I could spin up a working dashboard in hours, not days.

Beyond changing how we make visualisations, vibe-coding is also changing what we feel while building them. When you can go from an idea to prototype in minutes, without the slow learning that once came from writing and debugging code, there is an emotional arc to your technical workflow.

There is the thrill of instant creation, followed quickly by unease: disbelief that it works, frustration when small things break, and a creeping sense of not knowing how to debug. It can be disillusioning to sit with the feeling that you made something but don't fully know how. Some days it can feed imposter syndrome, other days it can re-assure you that your fundamentals are in place. I find myself constantly negotiating with what I still need to know, what I can defer learning, and what I may no longer need to learn in the data visualisation process anymore.

This dialogue will explore similar tensions and dilemmas in the minds of data visualisers. Some questions we will reflect on: Where does one begin to vibe-code? What tools and workflows do we reach out for? Which decisions still belong to the maker, and which are delegated to the tool? Who does vibe-coding open doors for, and whose work does it reshape? What do we do when it exposes gaps in our skills? Is it a career skill that can be taught and learnt? In the hands of founders, product managers, and designers, has vibe-coding helped? How are developers experiencing this shift? And as we move faster, how do we ensure quality, rigour, creativity, and trust in our products? How do we coordinate, deliver and scale data visualisations with this new method? 

Based on the discussion, we’ll map the shifting _vibes_ of making visualisations through vibe-coding with a simple emoji-based exercise. Participants will create their own _vibe-check_ chart: time spent vibe-coding on the x-axis, and sentiments such as thrill, disbelief, self-doubt, bargaining, acceptance or more, felt with varying intensity in the process, on the y-axis. Emoji stickers will be cut out and placed on the chart to mark how these feelings rise and fall. A sample version here: https://tinyurl.com/53t9sd87

The session will help participants articulate where they feel confident, where they feel lost, and what they want to hold on to as the practice shifts. Bring your wins, failures, half-started experiments, or fully shipped vibe-coded charts, dashboards, and visual projects. This will be a candid conversation about the emotional experience of making dataviz in this brave new world.",https://tinyurl.com/ykff2bua,https://tinyurl.com/53t9sd87,,"1.

As a narrative consultant, I help organisations articulate who they are, what they believe, and why their messages work(or do not). Over time, this work has left me with a persistent discomfort. Almost every storytelling framework I rely on assumes a single main character.

This assumption is deeply embedded in how we understand stories. From Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey to Gustav Freytag’s pyramid, dominant narrative structures are built around individual agency, conflict, and resolution. Even when stories claim to be about communities, movements, or cultures, they almost always narrow down to one person at a time. Individual stories are easier to aspire to, easier to remember, and easier to operationalise. They have become accessible enough to shape films, novels, political messaging, and even corporate branding.

But the world we are trying to describe, societies, organisations, and publics, does not actually work that way.

This session begins with a question I keep returning to. What does the story of a community look like?
If agency is distributed, what is the unit of action? How do multiple narratives interact, overlap, or contradict one another? And what are we simplifying, or losing, when we keep reverting to individual story structures simply because they are easier to work with?

This question has been explored before, but rarely in ways that are easy to work with in practice. Thinkers such as Benedict Anderson, Georg Lukács, and Gustave Le Bon have all, in different ways, treated collectives as narrative subjects. Yet these ideas remain difficult to translate into usable structures. As a result, we continue to fall back on individual heroes, not because they are always accurate, but because they are workable.

A second question follows naturally. If stories shape behaviour, power, and meaning, why are they so hard to see? When we try to imagine what a story like The Lion King looks like, we recall iconic images such as Simba being lifted into the sky atop Pride Rock. What we visualise is the imagery of the story, not its narrative structure. We do not see the arc, the relationships, or the forces shaping the story over time. We lack a visual language for narrative itself, especially for collective narratives.

In my practice, I have been experimenting with narrative visualisations to make this invisible layer more visible. These are not finished systems or polished frameworks. They are sketches, models, and provocations that attempt to surface relationships, tensions, and narrative gravity inside organisations. I have found that visualising narratives makes it possible to begin working with collective story structures that remain abstract in text alone.

This talk is a sharing of that journey. I will walk through the problems that led me here, the visual experiments I have tried, and the gaps I have not been able to solve alone. The goal is not to present a solution, but to open up narrative visualisation as a design space that invites collaboration across data visualisation, design, development, and systems thinking.

Participants will leave with new ways of thinking about stories beyond protagonists, early patterns for visualising narratives as systems, and an invitation to explore what becomes possible when we start working before heroes emerge. If stories shape our collective reality, then building ways to see them should itself be a collective effort.",,,,"Yes, many times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Bollywood and India’s regional cinema together produce over a thousand movies a year, to entertain the world’s most populous country.

Some of the easiest conversations I’ve had with strangers often start over a film or film-star. Everyone has opinions, favourites, loyalties, hot takes, sometimes plain gossip. We say that movies are getting longer and louder, that the industry is running out of ideas, that audiences don’t go to theatres anymore, that everything is a remake, that actresses have a shelf life. In a star-obsessed country, films shape public mood and hugely influence how we speak, dress, and dream.

For an industry that entertains a billion-plus people, numbers matter. Every project carries investment in production, distribution, marketing and is judged based on footfalls on first-day-first-show, budgets, ratings, reviews, box-office returns. Every release leaves behind a long data trail after the opening-weekend chatter fades.

I’ve spent the last few years following that trail, labelling film data to see what the chatter looks like when you quantify and plot it. These small experiments have grown into a series of visual stories about the economics of movie-making in Bollywood, its risk-reward dynamics, on and off-screen representation, and changing tastes of audiences.

Using charts from my own work, and some that have inspired it, I’ll walk through these visual projects and the process behind them to show how data visualisation can help us read the script behind our movies.

Fall in love with metrics that actually commit.

In today’s AI-driven, dashboard-heavy workplaces, we are surrounded by numbers. Impressions rise. Followers grow. Views spike. Yet behind the applause of “good metrics,” many teams struggle to answer a simple question: Did this actually move the decision?

This talk explores the gap between metrics that look impressive and metrics that influence real-world outcomes. Drawing from experience working in institutional strategy, admissions marketing, and AI-led product environments, I will unpack how visualization often reinforces vanity rather than clarity — and how we can redesign it to drive action.

At its core, this session is about reframing how we think about data at work. Instead of optimizing for visibility, we should optimize for decision-making. Instead of building dashboards that perform well in presentations, we must build visual systems that survive executive scrutiny, budget cuts, and real-world constraints.

The talk will move through three main sections:

1. The Illusion of Impact
How vanity metrics emerge in organizations, why they are psychologically attractive, and how visualization design unintentionally amplifies them.

2. Designing for Commitment, Not Attention
Practical principles for creating visualizations that highlight decision-critical signals — conversion funnels, trade-offs, risk indicators, and opportunity costs. This includes aligning charts with stakeholder questions, simplifying noise, and structuring dashboards around action.

3. From Reporting to Influencing
Case reflections on how visualization shifts when it becomes part of workflow rather than an end-of-month artifact. What changes when data is designed to guide conversations instead of decorate slides?

This topic matters deeply to me because I have seen how easily teams mistake activity for impact. In AI and product-driven spaces especially, data can create a false sense of confidence. Thoughtful visualization is not just aesthetic craft — it is organizational responsibility.

Within broader data visualization conversations, this session contributes to the ongoing dialogue about ethics, communication, and decision-support systems. It bridges design, strategy, and domain practice by focusing not on tools, but on intent.

This talk is intended for analysts, designers, product teams, marketing professionals, and leaders who build or rely on dashboards in their daily work.

Participants will leave with:

A framework to distinguish vanity metrics from value metrics

A checklist for designing decision-oriented dashboards

Mental models for aligning visualizations with stakeholder questions

A new lens for evaluating whether their data is influencing or merely informing

Because at work, attention is easy to get. Commitment is harder.

In this talk, I will share an overview of how data literacy is being reimagined in the new NCERT textbooks developed under NEP 2020. I plan to walk through the progression of ideas and concepts related to data literacy from the early grades up to Grade 12, highlighting not just the knowledge outcomes but also the skills, dispositions, and critical attitudes we hope to nurture in learners.

This talk explores the hidden risks of automated data tools and explains why our desire for total simplicity is often the problem. In our rush to make everything effortless, we are creating ""leaky abstractions"" that hide the messy reality of data from the people making decisions.

The core of this session is ""The Human Edge."" As AI masters the ""Genius"" of making charts, human value must shift to ""Judgment."" This is a critical conversation because data tools are increasingly used in high-stakes areas like healthcare and public policy. When a tool makes a guess, but the interface shows a solid, certain line, users lose their ability to question the outcome. I will use ""Tesler's Law"" to explain that complexity cannot be destroyed; it can only be moved. If we move all complexity away from the user, we also move away from their sense of responsibility.

This topic matters because ""automated certainty"" is a danger to our communities. In the data visualisation world, we often focus on aesthetics or speed. This talk shifts the focus toward ethics and systems thinking. It connects to the VizChitra mission by showing how the tools we build for ""Work"" directly impact the ""Community.""

### What is it about?

Data visualisations are quite a common part of modern journalism and storytelling — from data graphics that go with a text-driven story to visualisation-driven narratives. This talk explores the role of thoughtful design and art direction in news design so that even the most complex or dry subjects can become immersive and impactful narratives.

We’ll look at stories that are perhaps not too heavy on data but include information that needs to be delivered with an impact. Through real-world examples — financial data, electoral explanations, and so on, we’ll look at visual stories that not only inform but also engage the readers/viewers in an era of shrinking attention spans and information overload.   

Attendees will gain a framework for identifying visual opportunities, collaborating with designers and developers, and rethinking how information is structured for maximum impact. 

### Who is it for?

This is for anyone trying to ideate and create novel ways to represent data and information in digital publications. Whether you’re a journalist, editor, designer, or developer, this session will inspire you to move beyond the limitations of text and embrace the power of interactive narrative design to create stories that not only inform—but captivate your audience.

### What’s in it?

1. Understanding of narrative design and interaction patterns using examples from news media.
2. A framework for identifying visual opportunities, collaborating with designers and developers, and rethinking how information is structured for maximum impact.
3. Knowledge of how data, when artistically presented, can drive stories rather than being dry charts and graphics in a supporting role with text.

This talk will serve as a refresher on how far we have come in using data for narrative design and will explore examples where page design and art direction played a critical role in turning the story into an experience. e.g. https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GERMANY-ELECTION/ECONOMY/zjpqaqdorpx/ As the digital space gets saturated with interactive charts, dashboards, and linear stories, it is our responsibility as information designers to rethink and reimagine how we might captivate our audiences with well-designed information experiences.",https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GERMANY-ELECTION/ECONOMY/zjpqaqdorpx/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ELECTION/POLLING/gdpzdolqxpw/,https://medium.com/diarium-da-pacific,"Yes, many times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Shaurabh Anand, Gopi Sankar G

This workshop explores how organisations, researchers, students, and community members can transform data analysis into persuasive, audience-centred narratives. Across sectors, whether in research, policy, business, or civic initiatives, data is routinely used to understand problems, inform decisions, and evaluate outcomes. Yet valuable insights often fail to influence action because they are not communicated clearly or compellingly. This session introduces storytelling with data as a structured approach to converting analysis into coherent visual arguments that resonate with specific audiences.

The workshop engages with three key themes: narrative framing, visualization choice, and clarity in communication. Rather than treating visualization as a purely technical skill, the workshop positions itself within broader conversations in data visualization for presenting compelling stories. At the end of the workshop, the participants will be able to frame and select visualization and design clear, audience-oriented data stories.

Structure and Design

The workshop is organised into three progressive segments.

1. Framing the Story (45 minutes)
The workshop will begin with a discussion on what entails storytelling with data. Through discussions and illustrative examples, the participants will learn about purpose, and desired takeaway from storytelling. 

2. Developing a storyboard (60 minutes): 
Using a given data source, participants model raw data into a storyboard, moving from question to structured narrative. 

3. Choosing the Visual Form (75 minutes)
This segment focuses on selecting appropriate visualization techniques for numerical data. Instead of surveying many tools, we examine decision logic: comparison, trend, distribution, or relationship? Participants work with a provided dataset to identify a central message and design one visualization that best communicates it. They write a two-sentence narrative explaining the insight. A structured peer-critique exercise follows, encouraging reflection on clarity and audience alignment.


Interactive and Engaging Elements

The workshop relies on collaborative hands-on exercises, peer critique, and discusison. Participants actively construct and revise a data story rather than passively observing demonstrations.

Intended Audience

Anyone interested in data visualization.


Learning Outcomes

By the end of the session, participants will learn to:

Understand storytelling with data
Select visualization types aligned with communicative purpose
Design clear, audience-oriented data stories



Why This Topic Matters to us

In our experience working with data and teaching others to use it, we often see strong analysis lose impact at the stage of communication. This workshop responds to that gap. Effective data storytelling strengthens arguments by making their logic, evidence, and implications visible and accessible. In a world saturated with information, the ability to communicate insight responsibly and persuasively is essential across fields and professions.

The numbers are the same for everyone. And yet, within minutes, you have five different interpretations, five different “obvious” next steps, and one familiar question floating around—“How are you seeing this?”

Because the real variable isn’t the data. It’s the lens.

How do you think when things are unclear? How do you solve problems when every option has trade-offs? How do you visualise data when it’s incomplete, noisy, or politically loaded? Most of us don’t realise we’re answering these questions on autopilot, using default thinking patterns that feel “logical” because they’re familiar.

That’s exactly what this Cognilense workshop is built for.

So, what exactly is Cognilense?
CogniLense is a practical thinking toolkit, built as card decks created from Siddharth Kabra’s experience across hundreds of design and business problems. It gives teams a simple, structured way to switch perspectives on purpose, instead of getting stuck in one dominant viewpoint. These are problem solving tools to think from various perspectives and arrive at a holistic solution.

Here's what the worskhop looks like:
- The session centers on one idea: if you change the lens, you change the interpretations, decisions and conclusions. 
- Participants will work in small groups of 5–6
- A scenario-based activity where information is introduced in “data chunks,” just like real life—partial, messy, and open to interpretation. 
- Each participant takes on a specific thinking lens (the CogniLense “hats”; for example: optimist, skeptic, crook, judgement, process)
- The group debates the same situation from different angles before aligning on a conclusion. 
- We close with a guided debrief and reflection to surface what changed, why it changed, and what participants noticed about their own default patterns of thinking and visualizing data.


Who is the audience for the workshop?
People who work with decisions-making and different scenarios - especially those in product, design, business, data, marketing, leadership, and collaborative roles; where outcomes improve when teams can consider multiple viewpoints (not just the loudest one). Even students, designers, or any professional in data viz.

What will participants take away?
Participants leave with:
- Awareness of their own thinking patterns and blind spots
- A repeatable method to interpret and communicate data through multiple lenses.
- Sharper awareness of bias patterns (individual and group)
- A stronger ability to align teams around decisions, especially when the data is real, but the meaning is contested.
- A stronger habit of conscious thinking and visualising data, instead of autopilot conclusions.",https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/150laDnca48-e2Z57lK5mLAcj9K1nrckoY9NlomdSzBg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/monsoonfish_cognilense-x-caizin-activity-7254737057011412993-GSuk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACB6Ve0BydlfOIaQTi6oFPoile2za0dBtlY,https://monsoonfish.com/cognilense/home/,"Projector and screen set-up, mic & speaker, paper and pen for each participant to scribble their perspectives.",A room with a projector.,Keep,Under Review

Participants will get to use our tools (the GTFS data finder, route diagram generator, and the design system) to create maps for their own bus stop(s).

Most of the work we do at Bengawalk is about making the city of Bengaluru more accessible with design, tech and storytelling. Through this workshop, we want people to be part of this journey by making bus maps and testing our design system. The goal isn't just to visualize data but also understand how it shapes the way people navigate public systems.

Outcome:
At the end of the workshop, everyone will have created 1-2 bus stop maps!

The structure of the workshop is as follows:
30min - Introduction & Presentation
2hr - Workshop 
1hr - Lunch Break
1hr - Review and Q&A

The activities planned are:
1. Using GTFS to filter and categorise the bus routes from your bus stop.
2. Using our route diagram generator to get a base drawing of the route map.
3. Using Figma to tweak the design, refine hierarchy, labels, legibility etc to make it usable.
4. Review session to see everyone's maps side-by-side.
5. Reflections and Q&A
Of course, we will give demos and guidance at every step.

How it relates to conversations in data viz, especially for community: 
This workshop connects to larger data viz conversations around public infrastructure, open data, usability, and human-centered systems. Public transport data is rarely accessible. Raw GTFS feeds are complex, and without filtering, categorisation, and design, they remain a mystery to commuters. Data visualization is essential for civic design: how can we convert data into clear, legible visual systems that directly impact mobility?

Intended Audience

This talk begins with a simple belief:
we all repeat things.

We take familiar routes.
We postpone some tasks.
We call certain people more often than others.
We start routines, pause them, and return to them.
We move through news, moods, and environments every single day.

Sometimes we write these down. But after a while, those notes sit quietly, and we rarely return to them in a way that teaches us something.

So my question is simple:

We write about our lives. But what if we could see them?
Would that change our choices?
Would it help us understand who we are becoming?

In this talk, I will show how ordinary everyday moments can grow into visualizations that reveal who we are and how we move through the world.

I’ll share projects built from my own routines. For instance, I will talk about how documenting my metro commute helped me notice crowd rhythms and predictability. I will also share how mapping a BMRTC bus ride helped reveal who occupies space and how that shifts during the journey.

These did not begin with large or complex datasets.
They began with noticing and observing.

The talk will unpack my process:

- how I decide what is worth tracking.
- how I build discipline in data collection.
- what begins to change as days and weeks accumulate.
- how different visual approaches highlight different truths.

Along the way, I will show early attempts, iterations, mistakes, and the unexpected insights that only appeared after reflection from the visualization.

The intention is to make this practice feel accessible.
Not heavy.
Not technical.
Something anyone can begin.

This session is for anyone curious about patterns in their own life ~ design students, data practitioners, researchers, developers, and also people who may not work with data professionally but enjoy tracking habits, keeping logs, or reflecting on how their days unfold.

By the end of the session, people will start looking at everyday life a little differently.

They’ll notice that the small things they usually ignore ~ the routes they repeat, the delays, the pauses, the habits ~ are quietly telling stories about them.

They will see how turning these moments into visuals can help them spot patterns in their behaviour, become more aware of the environments they move through, reflect honestly on their choices, and understand how others experience the same situations.

They’ll leave with,

- Simple ways to begin their own tracking practices, 
- Approaches for translating logs into visuals, and most importantly,
- The reassurance that you don’t need big data or intimidating tools to discover something meaningful.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/nomeshwarireddy-84a288188/recent-activity/all/,,,"Yes, only once",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Creating charts with data is often a frustrating process when using traditional design tools. It typically involves exporting data to external charting libraries, restructuring spreadsheets in Excel, and spending hours pushing pixels - only to find that the result still isn’t quite right, just to repeat this process each time the data changes. And if you ever wanted to do something more custom, you quickly realise that you are fighting an uphill battle.

This is why I wanted to propose building charts and iterating in code. To most, this sounds like the lofty goal of learning D3.js. However the immediate stumbling block when starting to learn D3 is realising that it isn’t just a single tool they need to pick up -  it's a whole ecosystem of tools including HTML,CSS, JavaScript and then finally the D3 API. Courses on D3 essentially require that you become a full-fledged web developer before you even touch your first chart.

Over the years, I’ve learned that if you just wanted to start creating with data, this is all a bit overkill. The value in learning D3 isn’t in memorising its expansive API or mastering web development, but rather in understanding how to break down complex charts into simple shapes ( lines, circles, rectangles) and then map rows of data to draw these shapes on a screen.

Which is why, in this workshop, we’ll treat D3 as a helper tool, letting it handle the trickier parts like math and layout while we focus on building charts with a framework like Svelte. We’ll also break down complex charts into simple steps, and learn which sections can be supported by LLMs / online examples, and which parts benefit most from your own hands-on creative process.


### Flow of the workshop
The workshop would be a hands-on experience driven by simplified examples. We would cover just enough theory to get started with drawing with data. This would include basic HTML to draw SVGs and shapes inside it, minimal CSS and JavaScript where we will use D3 to prep the data for display.

While examples will include basic charts initially like bar charts and scatter plots, I would like to transition what we have learned to simplified versions of custom charts along the lines of the work of Federica Fragapane in [Renewables in Europe](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4afwEntKo-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), [Periodic Table](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwRqQh7FCqY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), etc.


### Takeaways
- Participants would get a sense of how to approach dataviz with code, going from idea to a working prototype
- Hands-on experience with creating custom charts in D3 that would otherwise be difficult without code
- Participants will gain a high-level understanding of web development through creating charts, with an introduction to HTML, minimal CSS, and a main focus on JavaScript - just enough to get started with building charts

The talk focuses on the design, development, and deployment of the eSankhyiki Portal, the NSO India’s unified digital platform that brings together more than 700 datasets and 136 million records from MoSPI other data-producing Ministries and Departments of the Government of India into a single, accessible interface.
The central idea of the talk is that visualization is not merely a presentation layer but a core part of the data lifecycle, from discovery and validation to interpretation and policy action. Through eSankhyiki, visualization becomes embedded within everyday workflows for policymakers, researchers, journalists, and citizens. The talk will demonstrate how thematic dashboards, interactive charts, filtering tools, and metadata-driven interfaces help users move from broad questions to specific insights while working with complex socio-economic data.
This topic matters deeply to me because of my long engagement with modernizing official statistics and making them more usable for diverse audiences. In public sector environments, visualization must operate under constraints of scale, data sensitivity, standards, and long-term sustainability. Building eSankhyiki required balancing technical robustness with clarity, accessibility, and trust which are the values that are fundamental to responsible data visualization.
The talk connects directly to ongoing conversations in the data visualization community around usability, accessibility, ethical representation, and visualization for public good. I will discuss how design choices were informed by user research, accessibility considerations, and the need for transparency through clear metadata and explanatory notes. I will also touch on the role of AI-enabled semantic search and how it complements visualization by improving data discovery.
The presentation will follow a clear narrative flow, beginning with the scale and complexity of India’s official statistics and the need for a unified dissemination platform, followed by a discussion of user needs and how they shaped visualization design. I will then walk through key features of eSankhyiki with concrete use cases, examine governance and regulatory constraints, and conclude with lessons learned and future directions for visualization in official statistics.
The intended audience includes data visualization practitioners, civic technologists, designers, policymakers, journalists, and researchers interested in applied visualization and public-interest data systems. Participants will leave with practical strategies for building visualization systems at scale, insights into designing for trust and usability, and a clearer understanding of how visualization can meaningfully shape real-world decisions inside large institutions.",https://esankhyiki.mospi.gov.in/,,,I have never given a talk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Visualization works well when it is anchored in business and implementation context: what problem you’re solving, what action you’re enabling, or what understanding you’re trying to build.

And honestly, I’ve seen this happen in almost every team at some point, even strong teams. You’re under pressure, you have data, and you feel like the next logical step is to visualize it. But over the years, across projects, products, and business problems I’ve learnt that this is usually how you end up with data that look great but don’t help anyone make a decision.

Purpose first, charts later. 
Visualization should start with intent, not with available data.
The chain: wisdom → knowledge → data → visualization.

First define what you’re trying to understand (wisdom), then what you need to know (knowledge), then what data supports it, and only then design the visual.

Visualization is a decision tool. 
A good data viz reduces ambiguity and makes the next step obvious (thresholds, alerts, ownership, drill-downs).
Match the visual to the job. Different formats serve different needs, seeing direction, prioritizing, spotting issues early, or explaining drivers.

This approach comes from years of building products and solving business problems where “pretty dashboards” often failed because nobody knew what to do with them. 
The talk shares the practical lessons learned from real work, what consistently makes visualizations useful, and what makes them ignored.

Because visualization is never the end goal. It’s a tool with a purpose. And most of the time that purpose is one of three things: solve a problem, enable an action, or build understanding. 

If you don’t know which of these you’re doing, you’ll end up visualizing everything and still not know what to do next.

How it connects to conversations in data visualization:
A lot of data viz conversations focus on chart types, tools, aesthetics, or storytelling. This talk adds a complementary angle: data viz as product design and leadership craft where success is measured by decision quality, action clarity, and business outcomes, not by visual polish alone.

Talk overview:
1. Why “data → chart” is the most common trap
2. The wisdom → knowledge → data → visualization chain
3. Method: A repeatable checklist for purpose-first visualization
4. Examples: How the same thinking applies across different contexts (ecosystems, products, operations, experience design)
5. Close: A simple principle to remember + what to do differently starting tomorrow

Who is this relevant to:
People working in products where multiple stakeholders rely on data to act.
Product leaders, founders, design leaders, data teams, analysts, and anyone responsible for dashboards, reporting, or decision-making systems especially people working in products where multiple stakeholders rely on data to act.

Key takeaways
A clear way to define *why* a visualization exists before designing it
A repeatable framework to move from business context to the right data and the right visual
Practical guidance on making data actionable (not just informative)
A mindset shift: don’t visualize data, visualize decisions

So the big idea is simple, and it’s something I’ve come to believe because I’ve seen it play out repeatedly: Don’t visualize data.

It tries to answer this through modules that get people to discuss, debate, and disseminate! Each session involves activities, games, and reflections about sex, bodies, gender, and education. 
We live in a world where all the information we could possibly need about sex education is right at our fingertips, yet somehow, we still struggle to have conversations about our bodies. The consequence of this stigma around talking about sex manifests itself in the different ways we normalise abuse in our daily lives. From catcalling on the streets, to slut-shaming at home, and even harassment in the workplace, we’ve created room in our realities for our minds and bodies to be constantly violated, because we’ve convinced ourselves that it’s easier to ignore, than to acknowledge and have conversations. Could talking about sex, sexuality, our bodies and gender more, lead to positive change? 
The project currently exists as 2 modules – “Media, Misogyny, and Me” and “The Large Language Module”, which explore the how our opinions and biases around sex and gender are shaped by media and language respectively. The links below are 1. For the project itself – a detailed repository of stories I’ve been collecting through these modules and a mapping of how these stories are connected; 2. The downloadable for the Media Module which includes instructions for each activity and the printables required; and 3. The downloadable for the Language module in that order. 
The modules have been designed with the following framework:
1.	An icebreaker based either on recollecting a memory or asking for an opinion. This activity needs to happen off the top of someone’s head, it’s the hook to get them invested in the rest of the session.
2.	A discussion prompt that establishes the main question(s) of the session. 
3.	Shared Experiences is a game that’s all about establishing common ground for all the participants by recollecting universal experiences. The discussion here is centred around WHY these experiences are so universal. 
4.	The Main Activity facilitates the brunt of the connection-making. A reflective activity that is focussed on pattern recognition and connection-building. This is the “diagnosis” part of the session, where we try to find the root of these opinions and ideas.
5.	The second discussion prompt is focussed on ensuring the connection between the first experiences covered up until the last activity, which will be somewhat removed from personal opinions and will be focussed on larger observations, making participants ponder about how small-scale decisions can have large-scale effects.
6.	And finally, a speculative drawing activity. This activity is future-focussed, with the goal of leaving a lingering image in the participants minds - either of fear or hope, depending on how your discussions go.

In practice, there are no clean maps. Every map is a negotiation between data sources, definitions, and vintages. Maps are not neutral mirrors of reality; they are reconciliations built on trade-offs and hard decisions.

This talk explores what it means to build spatial analysis when underlying geographies do not align across time, hierarchy, or definition.

Drawing from my work with village-level, pincode-level, hex-level, and district-level data, I unpack the analytical decisions required when:

1) Administrative hierarchies don’t align across time
Village shapefiles from 2011 coexIst with district boundaries updated in 2022. The hierarchy is conceptually nested but spatially inconsistent. What assumptions are embedded when we visualise one inside the other? How do these mismatches affect interpretation?

2) Parallel geographies coexist.
Districts and pincodes are both valid units, yet neither nests cleanly within the other. When users need insights at both levels, we are forced to construct relationships that do not naturally exist.

3) Granularity must be constructed
Data rarely comes at the level we need. To make it usable, we’ve had to create new spatial units to cover gaps, estimating population at village and pincode levels, and combining multiple sources to produce consistent analytical layers.

4) Spatial logics conflict
Datasets such as WorldPop operate on raster grids, while other datasets may rely on hex-based systems like Kontur’s hexes. Merging grids and hexes means translating between fundamentally different spatial assumptions about area, density, and aggregation.

5) Geographic provenance is unknown
Survey data often arrives at the district level without clarity on which boundary definitions were used. When boundaries evolve, a “district” is not a stable object. How do we responsibly visualise such data when the shapefile itself is uncertain?

Across these cases, mapping is not just a visual exercise but a series of analytical trade-offs. It requires deliberate choices about boundaries, aggregation, approximation, and how much uncertainty we are willing to carry forward.

Rather than presenting a single solution, this session argues that spatial visualisation begins long before design; in the invisible work of reconciling geographies. The question is not whether trade-offs exist, but whether we acknowledge and communicate them.

As a reporter for a magazine, I have extensively used QGIS to report on news stories. The workshop is designed for any interested participant to get started with maps and cartography on QGIS. But, we are not going to ‘just use’ the tool – we are going to map how uneven is the social infrastructure distribution of Bengaluru – is one neighbourhood hogging most of the green shade in the city? Does Devara Jeevanahalli have any schools? How many police stations does Bengaluru have and more importantly where are they located?

It expands on the ideas we are putting forward around how teams can think about making sense of qualitative data coming in from various sources, and how one goes from disparate quotes, transcripts, NPS feedback to answers and insights to important questions. It is targeted towards those who work in teams to help structure, analyse and present insights from various datasets especially for internal team decision making. 

The workshop would unfold in 3 parts:
1/  Initial introduction to the ideas in the talk so that everyone has a shared understanding and there’s time for resolving doubts, understanding any specific experiences to assimilate into the workshop design & flow

2/ Analog exploration of qualitative data
- We would present the case study, along with the decision that the company is trying to make
- We would then share bite-sized versions of the synthetic data in physical forms (exact formats to be decided), and setup the more detailed questions the company needs to answer using the data. 
- The participants would then have some time to go through the datasets, and pull out the data, both qualitative and quantitative, to gain insight and put forward recommendations for the decisions 
- Most importantly, we will explore how they can put forward their ideas with the backing of quotes, and patterns from the datasets 

3/ Digital Exploration
- We would then onboard the participants onto a version of the Dots platform that is already setup with the various datasets 
- The groups would then use the platform to work with a much more expanded dataset, and use various systems to filter and analyze the data along relevant variables and attributes

Learning outcomes:
+ Learn how insights emerge when qualitative data is structured across sources, variables, and attributes
+ Experience the difference between anecdotal reasoning and evidence-backed conclusions
+ Practice tracing insights back to supporting quotes, patterns, and datasets
+ Gain a transferable mental model for synthesising qualitative information into decision-grade insight
+ See how visual and structural organisation of data enables sense-making, not just summarisation

Rather than a presentation, the goal is to create a space where participants can compare real experiences of how insights actually travel — or fail to travel — into decisions.

Many teams today collect large amounts of qualitative information: interviews, support conversations, NPS comments, usability tests, field observations, and internal feedback. However, across product and program teams, a common pattern appears: research exists, but decisions are still driven by intuition, hierarchy, or dashboards. This dialogue invites participants to collectively examine why that happens.

We will guide the discussion through a set of prompts, encouraging participants to share practices, frustrations, and workarounds from their own organisations. The facilitators will not present solutions; instead we will help surface patterns across roles, sectors, and team structures.

Areas we want to cover:
- How qualitative data is gathered: What kind of qualitative data is gathered, who actually does it, how is this data managed
- How decisions are actually made: how does quant talk to qual, at what points does qual become absolutely necessary, how is the information analysed, how is it presented
- How have team structures + processes changed with the influx of AI: what actual changes have happened in workflows because of AI tools? Real change or a lot of Linkedin theater? 

Intended Outcome: 
Participants leave with a clearer understanding of how different teams handle qualitative knowledge, a shared language to describe internal challenges, and practical ideas drawn from peer experience. The session emphasises collective learning and reflection rather than instruction.

The reception was quite good, and I think we piqued everyone’s curiosity, and perhaps exploration. This year our talk addresses the next question: what does it actually mean to operationalise qualitative data so that it influences real decisions?
This year we would also focus the presentation through the lens of product companies such as D2C, digital consumer applications, so that it is more relatable to the Vizchitra audience. We want to be able to speak to those who have to support decision making using data, looking at how data is analysed, and how the insights are expressed to enable swift, and sure decisionmaking. 

The core idea of this talk is that qualitative data become really useful when we can look at various sources of data, and then analyse them structurally rather than only narratively. Product analytics platforms already do this with behavioural data: they construct cohorts, segment users by shared attributes, and examine patterns across variables. We argue that qualitative information can be analysed similarly — not by reducing it to numbers, but by organising it so patterns, relationships, and evidence chains become visible. 
To make this concrete, the talk will use a synthetic case study. We would introduce a fictional product company attempting to answer a realistic question about user satisfaction and retention. We will share a journey using combined datasets: NPS responses with written feedback alongside excerpts from research calls. We’ll use this case study to show how with these sources of data, and structuring using meta data and attributes can lead to useful insights that can drive decisions. 

This topic matters to us because we think that this is a glaring blindspot for many teams. And with the swift adoption of consumer AI tools people are dumping qualitative data into chat windows, expecting deep insights when all they’re going to get are summaries.

We refine visual hierarchies, optimise legibility, and ensure statistical integrity. Yet the narrative spine that determines what an audience ultimately understands is often left implicit.

When a story is not intentionally shaped or when there are gaps in its structure, the human brain goes into autopilot. It fills those gaps on its own. The result is simple. The message taken away is not necessarily the message that was presented.

This workshop introduces the idea of a Minimum Viable Story, the most basic narrative structure required to avoid a message being diluted or misinterpreted. Rather than treating storytelling as embellishment, the session positions narrative as a structural responsibility. Just as visual contrast makes data legible, story structure ensures insight is understood.

At the centre of this approach is the core insight. Before design decisions are made, before sequencing is finalised, before aesthetics are refined, one question must be answered clearly: What is the non-negotiable idea that must be understood? From that anchor point, the narrative can be reverse engineered by priming the audience to receive the insight and organising information in a way that supports it rather than competes with it.

Participants will work with shared material and reshape it around a clearly defined insight, observing how structural choices influence interpretation. The emphasis is not on making information entertaining, but on ensuring that it is understood as intended.

This workshop centres on foundational narrative structure. It may be less useful for practitioners who already employ established storytelling frameworks or who are deliberately experimenting with unconventional narrative forms. It is particularly suited to those whose primary focus lies in data analysis, craft, or visual design, and who are looking for a clear structural approach to presenting their work so that their intended insight is understood.

Designed for data designers, information designers, journalists, and visual communicators working with complexity, this workshop reframes narrative not as decoration, but as cognitive infrastructure.

Growing up in Bihar, I witnessed firsthand the economic imperatives that compelled countless individuals to leave their homes in search of better opportunities. My subsequent migration for education and career further solidified my understanding of the challenges and aspirations of those who traverse these geographical and emotional landscapes. This connection and passion became more stringer during the COVID-19 pandemic, where several workers were forced to migrate back to their roots, with heavy repercussion.

I envision a multidisciplinary project that combines performance, visual art, data visualization and sound to create a powerful and immersive experience. The collected narratives and objects will serve as the raw material for developing a script that weaves together personal stories and broader social commentary.

Or, perhaps, wondering if your local police station is effective? Or, maybe if all those election promises of cracking down on drugs, land/sand/alcohol mafia, and post-election action on comedians and “anti-nationals” have gone anywhere? 

In this talk, I'll run through on how one can digitally investigate cases by triangulating data from publicly-available court, police and media documents. This approach can be used to build robust datasets on virtually any criminal act in the country. No coding required and no fancy tech (okay, perhaps, a little optional use of LLMs at the end). It's an intentionally low-tech approach that allows one to develop datasets that can be used to analyse patterns or narrate compelling stories on how the State uses or misuses the power of the law. 

The creation of the dataset can be broken into two: discovery of cases; and its analysis. 

The core of the dataset is the FIR number. I'll run through some ways sneaky and not-so-sneaky ways to discover cases. This includes using RTIs with the police, trawling through e-courts for bail and other court orders, or finding FIR numbers through media articles or social media posts to find criminal and legal information. 

Once, you ""discover"" cases, I'll show a few ways in which one can build the dataset (here, is where a LLM may help), and how to find patterns and narrate these stories. 

I've spent a few years learning from previous datasets, while tinkering with ways to build larger datasets (and to build them quickly without the need for a team or coding). This talk is not about replication, but rather to serve as inspiration. The hope is that the audience will start tinkering with e-courts, police websites and media sites to build their own legal data sets for reporting, story-telling, accountability or to understand the shadowy world of police, courts and law.

Problem
Scientists and engineers in India often struggle to create visuals for their research papers that clearly communicate their ideas. One major reason is that most design and illustration tools are not built for science or for scientists. As a result, researchers spend weeks or even months trying to make figures and plots. Many end up publishing visuals that do not do justice to their hard work or the quality of their research. We are working to change this.
Outline
-A live demo of creating a highly detailed 3D illustration of drug delivery to cancer tissue in under one minute using Labcanvas.io. Which would take at least 3 to 8  hours in tools like Blender for an expert. This does not rely on AI image generation or ready made templates, but on structured generators.
-How building a community of scientific illustrators scicommtalent.com  helped scientists find and hire illustrators who truly understand their research
-How we can use Google AI Studio to rig SVG illustrations which scientists can customize without drawing. This  solved decades old problem in illustration tools ‘customizability’. This workflow is unique and something we developed ourselves.
-AI image generation is not the future in science visualization but generators are.
-What building free resources and tools for science visualization like moldraw.com, openscienceart.com, planticons.com, posterscientist.com, mapmypaper.com helped me learn about building solutions for dataviz.. How you also can build tools and resources even without coding skills with minimal cost.

While menstruation is discussed more openly now, the conversation often stays “safe”, relying on clean awareness campaigns and brand-friendly metaphors that avoid the real, messy texture of lived experience.

Meanwhile, the cost of silence keeps showing up in bodies, labour, and the spaces we live in. Policy may shift in parts of the formal world, but lived reality remains uneven, especially in informal work, where “missing a day” can mean fines, debt, or extreme measures taken just to keep earning.
We are two designers collecting fragments - language, rituals, labour, stories, myths, visuals around periods. 

We want to place these fragments in shared spaces for discussion and move past ""opinion exchange"" to look at the humor, contradictions, and costs of the silence we all navigate.

1.  Our Central Question is:

How do code words, slang, and unspoken rules shape how menstruation is understood and managed in everyday life, and what changes when we put these fragments together in the open? What changes when these private systems become visible as shared data?

2.  Who we want in the room:

People across ages, backgrounds, and work contexts (including informal work), plus designers/storytellers/researchers interested in how language and visuals shape reality. This session welcomes women, trans and non-binary menstruators.

3.  The Data & Visual Foundation:

This dialogue is anchored in our ongoing primary research, which has gathered 250+ responses through in-person interviews and digital surveys. This dataset captures a rich spectrum of experiences, including:

⤷ Context & Identity: How menstruation is managed across different labor conditions and environments.
⤷ The Language of Silence: A collection of period code words (English + local languages).
⤷ Physical & Emotional Markers: ""Period fits,"" body signals, rituals, and comfort foods.

4.  Dialogue Structure: 
(This is still a work in progress and we’d appreciate any guidance to figure this out further)

 ⤷ Introduction: 
Start with 3-5 questions like ‘Write the first word you were taught to use instead of ‘period.’ to start the conversation 

⤷ Discuss/dialogue/converse: 
Bring the language, the blood, and the rules into the open: reading slang, data, and lived accounts aloud and mapping the effort of hiding them, so menstruation appears in the room as it is: ordinary, material, and socially managed.

5.   What can they take away:
⤷ a shared vocabulary map of code words + what we “buy” (privacy/safety) 
⤷ a simple “period labour scorecard” that helps someone locate where period-related effort comes from (space + rule + cost) and score it 1–5.
⤷ a prototype of an “honest period visual language” moodboard / icon system (with do/don’t rules decided by the women, for the women)

6.   How we will visualize this for engagement:
Live Mapping: We will facilitate a live, physical visualization where participants can ""plot"" their own experiences using threads/stickers against the data visualization of the 250+ responses we’ve collected.

we will use generative tools to make visuals of these absurd objects; add a provocative caption (or poem even); and share it with people in the room, conference, or—if someone wishes to—on social media. if time permits, we can make frugal prototypes of these objects too.

- Maps as medium of storytelling – as a data graphic, as an full story medium, as art

### 2. Type of data maps

- Locator - Location of an event
- Symbol - Data at a point location
- Choropleth - Data for a region

### 3. Locator map

- Data is usually a set of latitude and longitude.
- Can add manually, copy paste google links
- Can get point list from excel
- Can get geojson from Google MyMaps
- Styling and exporting the map

### 4. Symbol map

- Data as a list of lat,lon along with a value to visualise
- Dataset from sheet
- Symbol sizing and styling

### 5. Choropleths

- Data as region and values
- DW has its own set of regions, so need to match up
- Choosing colour scales and styling

### 6. Advanced techiniques

- Adding custom geojson from Google MyMaps, ChatGPT
- Adding custom shapes from Overpass turbo

### 7. Common pitfalls of map design and how to avoid them

- Bad examples, especially choropleths
- Symbol sizing pitfalls - radius vs area, centered at middle (circle) or base (triangles)

This workshop focuses on the often-overlooked phase of data visualization: curiosity. Before choosing chart types or color palettes, we will ask better questions. Who collected this data? What is missing? What patterns are hiding? What contradictions emerge? What stories are possible and which ones are misleading? Participants will learn how structured exploration can reveal visual potential that is not immediately obvious.

The workshop is designed as an interactive journey in five parts:

**1. First Impressions:**

Participants are given a raw dataset and asked to spend 10 minutes simply observing. They will write down initial hypotheses, curiosities, and doubts. This stage emphasizes intuition before tools.

**2. Interrogation Framework:**

I will introduce a practical questioning framework: contextual questions, structural questions, anomaly detection, distribution exploration, and narrative angles. We will discuss how these questions shape eventual visualization choices.

**3. Exploring with Google Sheets:**

Using accessible tools like Google Sheets, participants will clean, sort, filter, pivot, and derive new columns. The goal is not advanced statistics but pattern discovery. We will look at grouping, ranking, outliers, correlations, and simple calculations that surface visual opportunities.

**4. AI as Research Assistant:**

Participants will experiment with AI tools to generate exploratory questions, suggest transformations, summarize trends, and challenge assumptions. We will discuss both the power and limitations of AI in exploratory analysis, treating it as a collaborator rather than a replacement.

**5. From Insight to Visual Potential:**

Finally, participants will sketch possible visual directions on paper. The focus will be on identifying the *right* visual strategy based on insight rather than defaulting to familiar chart types.

Interactive elements include small group discussions, timed exploration sprints, collaborative questioning exercises, and quick sketch critiques. Participants will leave with a reusable interrogation checklist and a structured approach to exploratory analysis.

This topic matters to me because many visualization projects fail not due to design skill, but due to shallow engagement with the data itself. As someone working at the intersection of design, code, and journalism, I have seen how deeper questioning transforms ordinary datasets into compelling information experiences.

Participants will learn how to interrogate datasets systematically, uncover patterns using accessible tools, collaborate with AI responsibly, and identify meaningful visual storytelling opportunities before designing.",https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDs9PQJU9iKYFO7VPsaqwhrmFwVUAvtWN&si=y49wERYTtsRmkS7r,,,,"Projector, Whiteboard, Internet ",Keep,Under Review

My afternoon is spent staring at them, trying to figure out which one is actually *good*.

After decades of building data viz - Excel, PowerPoint, D3 - the _making_ part is easy, and _FAST_. What's slow is the choosing.

Everyone has this problem. Vibe coding is a default. The bottleneck has moved from ""can I build this?"" to ""should I ship this, or that one, or the third version, or none of them?"" From construction to curation.

And most of us haven't developed the muscles for that yet.

This Dialogue is about that shift: the new, harder skill of selecting, evaluating, and refining from abundance rather than building from scratch.

**1. Our central question:**

AI tools generate multiple ""correct"" visualizations in minutes. What does good judgment look like - and how do we develop it?

What are the criteria, instincts, and craft knowledge that help us choose well from a sea of plausible options?

Is ""choosing"" even the right way to think about it, or is the real skill knowing how to steer the generation in the first place?

**2. Who we want in the room:**

Anyone who picks from multiple versions of a chart. Especially if AI has intruded into your viz workflow (whether enthusiastically or reluctantly).

Data journalists, dashboard designers, analysts, design students, and independent practitioners - a mix of experience makes this richer: seniors bring taste they've built over years; juniors bring fresh eyes and the honesty of not yet having defaults.

**3. The shape of the dialogue:**

- **The Exercise (10 mins):** You'll see five visualizations (AI/human-made, unlabeled) of one dataset on a wall or screen. Rank them on effectiveness with colored dot stickers. We'll have an instant, visible map of the room's collective judgment before anyone speaks.
- **The Discussion (15 mins):** Groups of 4-5 compare rankings and articulate the *why*. We'll use prompt cards, e.g. ""What did you notice first?"" / ""Which one would you trust in a news article?"" / ""Which one would you be proud to have made?"" / ""What's missing from the one you ranked lowest?"" The goal isn't consensus - it's **surfacing the criteria** people use, often unconsciously.
- **The Reveal (10 mins):** I'll reveal which were AI-generated. Revisit rankings. Did knowing the origin change anything? Did any AI-generated chart rank high? Did any human-made chart rank low? This is where the conversation gets honest - about bias, what ""craft"" means, and whether origin even matters if the result is effective.
- **The Rubric (10 mins):** Each group contributes 2-3 criteria they used (or wish they'd used) for evaluation. I'll pin these on a shared wall and cluster them. The room works together to draft a rough ""curator's checklist"" - not a rigid scoring system, but questions we can ask when choosing among multiple visualization options.

**4. Takeaways:**

Using SurakshaLens as a case study, the session will unpack how data can move beyond dashboards and surveillance logic to become a tool for prevention, resilience, and collective agency.

SurakshaLens is envisioned as a climate exploitation risk platform that identifies patterns linking climate stress, migration pressures, and trafficking vulnerabilities. But the central question is not technological, it is ethical and political: How do we ensure such a platform is built with communities, not merely about them? How do we translate complex data into insight that district officials, frontline workers, and community leaders can use? And how do we prevent data tools from reinforcing harm, stigma, or over-policing?

Key discussion themes include:
	•	Translating data into protection: from signals to actionable prevention
	•	Community-led design and participatory data processes
	•	Ethical AI and safeguards in vulnerable contexts
	•	Visualization as a bridge between evidence and decision-making
	•	Trust, accountability, and long-term resilience

This topic matters deeply to me as a criminologist working at the intersection of climate risk, exploitation, and technology. Too often, data systems in justice and security contexts are extractive, opaque, and imposed from above. SurakshaLens attempts a different approach — one grounded in community validation, multilingual accessibility, and practical usability for frontline actors.

The session connects directly to broader conversations in data visualization. Effective visualization is not about aesthetic clarity alone; it is about power. Who interprets the data? Who benefits from it? Who is protected by it? We will explore how layered mapping, risk indexing, and simplified visual narratives can translate complex, multi-source data into tools that strengthen early warning systems rather than intensify surveillance.

The session will be structured in three parts:
	1.	Framing the Challenge – Brief introduction to climate-linked exploitation risks and the need for preventive data systems.
	2.	Designing with Communities – Interactive discussion on participatory design, ethical guardrails, and trust-building.
	3.	From Data to Action – Small-group dialogue on what makes a platform usable, accountable, and locally owned.

The intended audience includes data visualization practitioners, technologists, researchers, policymakers, civil society actors, and community advocates interested in ethical data use and public-interest technology.

Participants will leave with:
	•	A clearer understanding of people-first data design principles
	•	Practical considerations for translating complex data into protective action
	•	A framework for embedding ethics and community ownership into digital platforms
	•	Insight into how data visualization can strengthen resilience rather than merely monitor risk

Ultimately, this session asks: What would it mean to build data systems that communities trust, shape, and use to protect themselves?",https://www.saicjs.com/suraksha-lens-1,https://www.saicjs.com/climate-exploitation-risk-index,,,"Projector, white board, breakout space ",,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

In journalism, we often work with datasets, charts, and visual explainers. But when it comes to creating interactive tools or dashboards, the work usually depends on technical skills or developer support. I faced this challenge while reporting on food price data. Although we published stories and static charts, I felt something was missing. Readers could see the information, but they could not explore trends, compare states, or interact with the data in a meaningful way.

This led to a practical question: Can a journalist build a dashboard without being a coder?

The talk shares how I began experimenting with AI tools to help bridge this gap. Instead of presenting AI as an easy solution, I will discuss the process, including trial and error, confusion, incorrect outputs, and the time spent understanding what was happening. Over time, I realised that building a dashboard is not only about writing code. It involves making decisions about what data to include, how to structure the interface, how users might interact with it, and what insights are worth highlighting.

A key part of this journey was developing a diet cost calculator. Rather than only showing food prices, this feature attempted to answer a more relatable question: What does it cost to afford a basic daily diet? This shift helped connect the data to everyday realities.

This talk connects to wider discussions in data visualization about accessibility, learning new tools, and how AI is changing creative and analytical work. The session will move through the problem, the experiment, the challenges, the design decisions, and the lessons learned.

This talk is intended for journalists, designers, students, and anyone curious about building with data.

Most of us who work in data visualization operate in high-stakes environments. We document crime to guide intervention. We track climate indicators to influence policy. We build dashboards for compliance, governance, and strategic decision-making. In these contexts, data must justify itself. It must lead to action. It must solve.
This talk asks a different question: What happens when we remove the need for action?
At its core, this session explores non-transactional data visualization—work that does not optimize, predict, or prescribe, yet still produces meaning. Through two personal projects, I examine how data can deepen perception rather than drive decisions.
The first project documents the 8 hours of a World Endurance Championship race in Bahrain. Instead of visualizing lap times or pit strategies, I captured the sky every 20 minutes and extracted its gradient. These gradients were animated sequentially and paired with the top three race leaders at each interval. The result is a temporal artifact: a visual memory of atmosphere and competition coexisting. It offers no strategic insight, but it creates a new way of experiencing the event.
The second project maps the spatial dimensions of Finnish lakes during a data visualization course in Finland. Using dimensional data sourced from Jarviwiki and manually drawing the lakes to scale, I constructed a spatial study of surface area and depth. This visualization does not inform environmental policy. Instead, it transforms abstract numerical data into perceivable form, allowing viewers to sense structural relationships and spatial hierarchy.
Together, these projects illustrate two modes of “beautifully useless” data: data as atmosphere (time-based, experiential) and data as form (spatial, perceptual).
This topic matters to me because my professional practice sits at the intersection of systems and storytelling. I work as a UI/UX designer across apps, websites, and vehicle displays, and have also contributed to environmental CSR initiatives at Hero MotoCorp, along with internal reporting systems. Much of this work is structured, accountable, and outcome-driven. While I value that responsibility deeply, I’ve found that stepping into curiosity-led visualizations—outside compliance and performance metrics—sharpens my sensitivity to patterns, relationships, and unexpected juxtapositions. It expands my creative range in ways that structured outputs alone cannot.
Within broader data visualization discourse, this talk connects to ongoing conversations about aesthetics, interpretation, storytelling, and the balance between analytical rigor and creative exploration. As the field matures and increasingly centers impact and accountability, there is also space to discuss play, observation, and perception as legitimate contributions.
The structure of the talk follows a clear arc: first, acknowledging the serious responsibilities of professional data work; second, introducing the concept of removing actionability; third, presenting the Bahrain project (time and atmosphere); fourth, presenting the Finland lakes project (space and structure); and finally, synthesizing both into a framework for perception-driven visualization.
The intended audience includes data practitioners, analysts, designers, and researchers who primarily create visualization for decision-making contexts.
The key takeaway is not that data should abandon impact—but that impact is not the only valid outcome. Visualization can also function as documentation, memory, juxtaposition, and perceptual inquiry. By occasionally allowing data to wander without pressure, we may discover new sensitivities, new forms of seeing, and new creative depth in our serious work.
Data can be used like language—sometimes to write a report, and sometimes to write a poem.

Someone had shared data about Mumbai's data centers - how they consume as much electricity as thousands of households, how diesel generators near slum areas pump out toxic fumes. The next day, I saw Elon Musk's announcement about building AI factories on the Moon, arguing Earth doesn't have enough energy to scale AI. Something about that felt backwards. We're talking about launching factories into space while people in Mumbai are dealing with power shortages and air pollution from data centers already here?
So I started investigating. What began as curiosity turned into weeks of mapping data centers, downloading air quality datasets, and pulling satellite imagery. I wanted to see what AI infrastructure actually costs us.
What I found in Navi Mumbai's Airoli area was stark. Forty-seven data center facilities operate near Cheetah Camp , a settlement with crumbling infrastructure, built after residents were evicted decades ago. People report their electricity bills climbing while data centers expand next door, powered by coal plants authorities keep running for 24/7 AI workloads.

What This Talk Covers:
This talk walks through that investigation, showing how publicly available tools like satellite thermal imagery, CPCB air quality monitors, power grid data can map this pattern across Indian cities. The methodology is straightforward enough that anyone could replicate it, which feels important.
I'll present visualizations showing the correlation between data center locations and environmental impacts, use ML models to forecast which cities face grid crises first under current growth, and discuss accountability frameworks: carbon budgets for AI training runs, mandatory energy reporting, AI workload auditing.

Why This Matters:
This topic matters because right now, AI's benefits and costs go to completely different people. Tech companies get profits, vulnerable communities get pollution and power cuts. That's not inevitable , it's a choice. This connects to data visualization's role in advocacy and accountability making invisible power structures visible.

Talk Structure :
1.The question: Why space solutions when Earth's infrastructure creates crises? 
2.The investigation: Mapping methodology and findings.
3.What accountability looks like: Frameworks and global examples.
4.Tools and call to action.

Intended Audience:
Data journalists, civic tech practitioners, environmental advocates, policy analysts, and anyone curious about technology's real costs. No technical background needed.

Key Takeaways:

- Replicable methodology using only public datasets
- Interactive visualizations adaptable for any city
- Understanding of AI workload auditing as policy tool
- Toolkit for community-driven tech accountability

I keep waiting for the era where we finally retire the pie chart. Or at least admit we’re tired of pretending a bar chart is a revelation. And yet, somehow, we’re still here, polishing the same geometries for every datasets.

And I have a suspicion others feel this too. That quiet tension between “just make it pretty” and “just make it clear.” Wanting something that feels alive. As data and visualization become increasingly abstract and as AI tools make image generation effortless,I worry we’re eroding lived meaning.

I’m tired of cleaner charts that stop feeling so distant and beautiful visualizations,that stay emotionally detached. The workshop turns on one lever: Does our data form actually carry the structure, behaviour, and meaning of what it represents?

Before dashboards, humans used fables, myths, and animal stories to communicate complex moral and epistemic truths. Ant colonies taught distributed labour.Seasonal migrations encoded time and memory. These weren’t plain metaphors, they were cognitive structures that made complexity graspable. 

This workshop is about bringing them back, without nostalgia, without illustration-for-its-own-sake. We’ll draw from biophilic systems (animals, insects, plants, ecological behaviours) and lore (cultural narratives that already carry meaning), to re-embody data in meaningful, situated ways. Not “data is like ants.” But “information density in this mode follows pheromone-trail logic.”

The structure of this workshop:

I’ll introduce Six Ecologies of Lived Data in this workshop namely: System, Flux, Echo, Adversial, Affectie and Commons. Using these modes, participants reinterpret their dataset into compelling, unforgettable and breathing data lores.

Participants will:

1. Begin with a dataset: Bring or generate a dataset (social, environmental, urban, or cultural).

2. Discover biophilic systems and lore: Learn how to research living systems and cultural narratives using structured prompts and guided inquiry.

3. Deconstruct both dataset and living system: Break down the dataset into behaviours (flow, density, hierarchy, feedback). Break down the organism or lore into structural features (growth logic, swarm patterns, decay cycles, memory traces).

4. Practice metonymic association: Identify precise structural correspondences between dataset behaviour and living system behaviour.

5. Reinterpret through the Six Systemic Ecologies: Apply the mode of System, Flux, Echo, Adversarial, Affective, or Commons to deepen interpretive framing.

6. Prompt and de-prompt with AI: Generate variations, then strip away aesthetic excess to reveal underlying grammar.

7. Extract a visual grammar to create a one-page “data fable”

Who is it for?

This workshop is for designers, data practitioners, students, artists, researchers, and civic technologists who sense that visualization today oscillates between sterile abstraction and aesthetic spectacle. It is especially relevant for early-career practitioners looking to move beyond default charts, AI-enabled designers seeking deeper conceptual control, and cross-disciplinary collaborators working at the intersection of narrative, ecology, and culture.

No advanced technical skills are required. Only access to an AI tool for prompting and image generation, and a simple presentation platform such as Figma, Canva, or Google Slides. They leave with a practical method, a critical AI workflow, and a renewed lens: data can be lived, storied, and situated, not merely rendered.

Real-world problems are often complex and messy, involving multiple dimensions and rarely offering a single straightforward solution. We have been working with questions around such wicked problems: How do we better understand what makes people vulnerable? And just as importantly, how do we help build resilience among communities that are already at risk? 

At Fields of View, we build tools that untangle the messiness inherent in real-world systems through games and simulations. Modelled on real-world data and institutional processes, these tools translate layered datasets into interactive interfaces. Rather than presenting data as static visualisations, we embed it within systems that allow participants to experience trade-offs, constraints, and unintended consequences. This session shares our ongoing work of how games and simulations can push the boundary of how we design with data - from understanding data to interacting with it. 

Objective and key themes 
Through the Dialogues discussion, we aim to deconstruct what it means to model real-world data into interactive game elements for various types of practioners- designers, techologists, and researchers amongst others. The discussion will focus on:  

- Building interfaces that make complex data and disciplinary approaches more accessible and actionable  

- Translating multi-layered datasets into engagement in the game  

- Using interaction with data to understand trade-offs 

  
Structure  
We begin with a facilitated 15-minute gameplay of Scheme! - a simulation-based game developed to question how we understand support for vulnerable communities. Participants will engage directly with the game rather than first being told about it. 

Following the gameplay, an Open Question Circle (15 minutes) will invite participants to reflect on what datasets, disciplinary approaches, and modelling assumptions they believe informed the game design. This conversation surfaces how data is interpreted, abstracted, and translated. 

In the final 15 minutes, we will share the underlying models, datasets, and design decisions used to build the game. This Experience Exchange will open discussion on alternative approaches, and other ways complex data might be represented and engaged. 

Intended Audience 
This session is intended for data visualisation practitioners, technologists, designers, researchers, and others working with complex systems and public data. 

Takeaways  
The key takeaway of the discussion is to aid an introduction into how games and simulations can create a space where complex data is not just visualised, but interacted with, and most importantly engaged with to help make more informed decisions.  

We hope to open up conversations around what kind of tools, methods and approaches can make data that often sits in spreadsheets and is accessible only to a select few, more engaging and actionable.",https://fieldsofview.in/tools/scheme/,https://scheme.fieldsofview.in/,https://fieldsofview.in/,Laptops for participants to play the game,"Room with a Projector, Laptops/Screens for participants to play the game.

I keep waiting for the era where we finally retire the pie chart. Or at least admit we’re tired of pretending a bar chart is a revelation. And yet, somehow, we’re still here—polishing the same geometries for every new dataset.

I suspect many of us feel that quiet tension between “just make it pretty” and “just make it clear.” Wanting something that feels alive. As data and visualization grow more abstract and AI makes image generation effortless, I worry we’re eroding lived meaning.

I’m not against cleaner charts. I’m against charts that feel distant. Against beautiful visualizations that remain emotionally detached. The central question of this talk is simple:

Does our data form actually carry the structure, behaviour, and meaning of what it represents?

Before dashboards, humans used fables, myths, and animal stories to communicate complex moral and epistemic truths. Ant colonies illustrated distributed labour. Seasonal migrations encoded time and memory. These weren’t decorative metaphors. they were cognitive structures that made complexity graspable.

This talk is about reclaiming that structural thinking, not through nostalgia, not through illustration-for-its-own-sake, but through precision. Drawing from biophilic systems (animals, insects, plants, ecological behaviours) and cultural lore, I’ll show how we can re-embody data in situated ways.

Not “data is like ants.”
But “information density here follows pheromone-trail logic.”

What I’ll Present:

I’ll introduce a framework I call The Six Ecologies of Lived Data:

System – interdependence

Flux – growth and decay

Echo – memory and trace

Adversarial – tension and resistance

Affective – emotional intensity

Commons – shared meaning

Through live and applied examples, I’ll demonstrate how to reinterpret a dataset through these modes and identify what structural qualities must be preserved in form.

I’ll show how to:

Begin with a dataset and map its behaviours—flow, density, hierarchy, feedback.

Research and identify a living system or lore with structural parallels.

Deconstruct both the dataset and the living system to find precise correspondences.

Shift from metaphor to metonym—from surface similarity to structural alignment.

Use AI thoughtfully: prompt for variation, then strip away aesthetic excess to reveal the grammar beneath.

The focus is not on producing a new chart type, but on changing how we begin. On asking better questions before we render.

Who This Talk Is For

Designers, data practitioners, students, artists, researchers, and civic technologists who feel visualization today oscillates between sterile abstraction and aesthetic spectacle. Especially those working with AI who want conceptual control rather than aesthetic automation.

No advanced technical skills are assumed. This is about mindset, method, and structural thinking.

You’ll leave with:

A new mental model: data can be lived, storied, and embodied, not merely rendered.

A practical way to think in metonyms rather than metaphors.

A framework for asking whether your visualization actually carries the system it represents.

This talk explores how the metaphor of tree rings became the foundation for translating 60+ years of alumni history into a tangible artifact. What began as a keepsake for 150+ alumni evolved into a deeper design investigation: how can data be transformed into physical form in a way that fosters identity, and belonging?

At its core, this project represents a shift in perspective from visualization as something viewed on a screen to visualization as something held, gifted, and remembered. The tree ring metaphor became the organizing framework or translating decades of alumni history. Institutional identity informed the visual language, while the constraint of a 3-inch surface demanded clarity, and intentional abstraction.

This topic matters deeply to me because my professional work in cybersecurity focuses on designing large-scale, high-stakes visualization systems. In contrast, this project asked: what changes when data is designed to be held instead of viewed? The turning point came when an alumnus shared that his father, a forest officer, used to bring home logs and ask him to count the rings. Seeing the magnet brought those memories back. That moment revealed something powerful: when visualization connects to lived experience, it becomes immersive and human

This talk contributes to conversations in data visualization around craft, materiality, and community-centered design. It expands the field beyond screens and tools into physical artifacts and social infrastructure, demonstrating how metaphor can drive design decisions not just aesthetics.

The presentation will unfold in five parts:

The Design Challenge: Encoding time, identity, and institutional memory within a fixed 3-inch surface. What do you include? What do you remove? 
Metaphor as Structure: How the tree ring metaphor became the organizing framework.
From Artifact to Belonging: Community response, including the forest officer story, illustrates how data becomes meaningful when it connects to lived experience.
A Framework for Designing Data as Belonging: Conclude by distilling the process into a reusable framework for translating data into tangible artifacts focusing on metaphor-driven structure, designing under constraint, encoding identity over explanation.

This talk is intended for designers, visualization practitioners, crafters, and anyone interested in expanding what visualization can be.

Key takeaways include:
* A framework for translating metaphor into structure.
* Insights into creating visualization artifacts that foster belonging.
* What becomes possible when data is designed to be held?

The talks aims to document some of the best practices while visualizing data on a map especially in the Indian Context? 

CONTEXT

It is an exciting time to make maps. Free and Open Source tools have democratized map making . More and more data is being represented spatially. However, key cartographic principles need to be kept in mind while representing data spatially to help us to tell the truth and not be misled while creating a map. 

What are the ideal scenarios for picking between choropleth vs spot vs hex-bin maps? When should data be normalized? How do we identify clustering? How does one deal with the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem or the Area Bias Problem? 

Mapping can also be a hyperlocal activity. The same area in India may have different divisions for revenue, elections and administrations. New districts often emerge which make comparisons across time. How have teams managed this problem while working on their own projects? 

WHO IS THIS DIALOGUE FOR?

This dialogue is for any one who makes maps or wants to make maps.  Having a group of experienced practitioners in the mix will be ideal as this is intended to be a discussion and not advice. It is intended as a peer exchange where experienced mappers can share their workflows and newcomers can learn the ""hidden"" principles of map-making in India.

At its core, Vibe Charting is about lowering the barrier between hypothesis and insight. Instead of committing to a full-scale data project, we quickly gather relevant data, restructure it with the help of modern LLMs, generate lightweight charts, and observe whether patterns meaningfully support or challenge our initial thought.

The process begins with a spark — a question, intuition, or hypothesis. Traditionally, validating such ideas required substantial effort: sourcing data, cleaning it, structuring it, selecting appropriate visual forms, and preparing narratives. Today, large language models significantly compress that workflow. They can assist in scraping public information, restructuring messy text into tables, summarizing documents, and even suggesting chart formats. This allows us to “feel” the shape of an idea early — to test its viability before investing heavily in polish or infrastructure.

This topic matters deeply to me because I work with teams that aspire to be data-driven but often hesitate at the starting line. The friction of tooling, uncertainty about datasets, or fear of imperfection delays insight. Vibe Charting reframes visualization not as a final artifact but as a thinking tool. It is a cognitive accelerator — a way to cut inertia and let data participate in early-stage reasoning.

Within broader data visualization conversations, Vibe Charting sits at the intersection of exploratory analysis, narrative framing, and AI-assisted workflows. It challenges traditional boundaries between data preparation and storytelling. However, speed must not come at the cost of integrity. The talk will also address the risks introduced by LLMs — hallucinated data, weak sourcing, and overconfidence — and propose practical guardrails such as source tracing, explicit assumptions, and verification loops.

The structure of the talk will follow a clear arc. First, I define Vibe Charting and contrast it with traditional dashboard-building. Second, I introduce the “Vibe Loop”: Spark → Data Capture → Restructure → Visualize → Narrate → Reflect. Third, I demonstrate short case studies showing how a rough hypothesis can quickly become a simple but revealing chart. Finally, I discuss how to evolve a promising vibe chart into a robust, publishable visualization.

The intended audience includes data practitioners, designers, product managers, journalists, researchers, and founders — anyone who works with uncertain ideas and imperfect datasets.

The key takeaway is a repeatable mindset: visualize early, validate quickly, refine deliberately. Vibe Charting empowers people to treat visualization as a dynamic thinking process rather than a final deliverable — making data exploration more accessible, iterative, and creatively energizing.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ananthmani_indianit-outsourcing-innovation-activity-7421421561271857152-jbpW?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAADvx9QBejweYqLjJcNK9mIxGDAInjxMTmA,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ananthmani_datavisualization-indianeconomy-techtrends-activity-7419270104057606144-IInh?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAADvx9QBejweYqLjJcNK9mIxGDAInjxMTmA,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ananthmani_vibedataanalytics-inflation-indiaeconomy-activity-7416075307989831680-mdWK?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAADvx9QBejweYqLjJcNK9mIxGDAInjxMTmA,"Yes, many times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

What problem or question are you centering?
Invisible labour for women in India -- domestic work, emotional labour, and cognitive load -- remains economically and socially unmeasured.

Women perform hours of daily work that, Do not appear on salary slips, Are not counted in GDP, Are not reflected on LinkedIn profiles


Key questions we want to explore:
How many hours of unpaid labour do women perform daily compared to men?
- If this labour were paid, what would it cost annually?
- How much of women’s “free time” is actually mental planning time?
- What is the “Emotional Labour Tax” in relationships and workplaces?
- How does invisible labour affect career growth and lifetime earnings?

‘Because if you don't measure something you can pretend it doesn’t exist’



Who is the audience for your session?
This session is designed for:
- Young urban couples
- Corporate employees navigating gendered expectations 


It is for anyone who says, “But I help.”



What is the scope of your session?
The session will present results in the form of reactions, reflections and conversations started from a series of interactive satirical data visualizations that:
- Quantify unpaid labour in hours
- Translate those hours into monetary value
- Visualize mental load (planning, anticipating, remembering)
- Explore the emotional labour gap in relationships
- Examine long-term economic consequences
	
The tone will be satirical and playful on the surface – exaggerated and colorful but grounded in real data. 



What will the participants take away ?
How Satire, Playful Imagery, and Gamified Experiences spark conversations on Invisible Labor. These tools can make complex issues accessible by helping us:
- See invisible labor translate into measurable numbers 
- Understand its economic implications 
- Recognize how gendered systems shape both men and women 
- Gain a new lens of examining domestic and emotional work



Ideal outcome: Conversation that go beyond the room
We hope participants share the visuals with their partners and families, spark reflection and keep conversation alive around redistribution of labour.

I build systems that transform complex network data into intuitive, high-performance visual experiences for critical decision-making.",,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/guptakuhu/,Talks,I consent to VizChitra publishing my submission and the review of my application.,TRUE,Visualizations at Work,Crafting Systems: Designing Visualization at Scale,"In cybersecurity products, charts do not merely communicate, they influence operational decisions and stop breaches. A color can signal urgency. A percentage can imply completeness. A missing category can hide risk. Yet inside many organizations, visualization systems evolve in fragments: similar datasets look different across products, interaction patterns vary, accessibility is inconsistent, and design decisions are made locally rather than structurally. These inconsistencies are not cosmetic but its shapes how people interpret risk and act on it.

This talk explores what happens when you treat visualization not as a collection of charts, but as a system.

The project began as an internal audit of existing charts across multiple product surfaces. We mapped redundancies, misalignments, unclear encodings, and goal drift. What emerged was not just the need for a style guide, but for a shared visualization grammar, one that aligned color logic (including accessibility and brand constraints), chart-type decision rules, interaction patterns, widget design, and labeling standards to user goals. We also introduced a Product Manager checklist to anchor every visualization to a decision outcome rather than an aesthetic preference.

The core idea of this talk is a shift in perspective: from visual consistency to decision consistency. A style guide is not simply a design reference; it is a governance mechanism. It formalizes how risk is represented, how clarity is constructed, and how action is implied. In doing so, it influences not just what people see, but how organizations think and act.

The presentation will be structured in four parts:
1. The Audit: Recognizing fragmentation as cognitive risk.
2. The Framework: Building modular visualization rules.
3. Institutionalizing Vision: Aligning design, engineering, and product.
4. Sustaining Systems at Scale: What breaks under scale, how systems drift, and how coherence is actively maintained.


This topic matters to me because I work in cybersecurity, where visualization directly affects real decisions. When a chart is unclear or inconsistent, it can influence how risks are interpreted and acted upon. This talk connects to ongoing conversations in data visualization about design systems, accessibility, consistency, and trust. It brings those ideas into the context of enterprise products, where visual decisions must work reliably at scale and support high-stakes use cases.

The intended audience includes designers, engineers, product managers, and practitioners working inside organizations who are navigating fragmentation across dashboards or data products.

Key Takeaways: 
* A practical approach to auditing visualization ecosystems.
* A framework for building shared visual grammars.
* A model for turning style guides into living systems.

",,https://x.com/bargava,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bargava,Talks,I consent to VizChitra publishing my submission and the review of my application.,TRUE,Visualizations at Work,Designing for Speed and Trust : Visualization Lessons from building AI in Radiology,"### Abstract

Radiology is an inherently visual domain where the primary input is an image (Xray/CT/MRI) and the output is a diagnosis, in the form of a text-based report. In this high-stakes environment, both efficiency and accuracy are paramount. However, the integration of AI has introduced a dangerous trade-off between **Speed** and **Trust**. While AI aims to be an assistant, ""black box"" computer vision models often increase cognitive load, forcing radiologists to choose between blindly trusting a fast algorithm or slowing down to verify opaque predictions. 

How do we design interfaces that optimize for both speed and trust simultaneously? How do we maintain a balance between human agency and AI automation in visualization tools built for explanation, exploration, and decision-making?

This talk discusses a framework to resolve this conflict using **Spatial Anchoring**, transforming “black box” AI  into intuitive, decision-supporting narratives.

The speaker shares his journey to designing representations that build trust with the doctors without compromising reporting speed. The speaker shows how to synthesize insights from multi-dimensional inputs - 2D/3D slices of the scan, 3D volumes and the temporal nature of the scan and the patient’s history - into layered visual encodings that amplify the reporting experience for the Radiologist. The speaker discusses the journey from visual metaphors that failed in non-intuitive ways to building progressive disclosure interfaces that eventually worked.

The talk will demonstrate specific visualization techniques that bridge the gap between raw data(scans), AI output (from computer vision and LLMs) and clinical insights (from doctors).  

• **Anatomical Heatmaps**: Contextualizing complex pathologies by mapping data directly onto 3D patient avatar, using spatial anchoring to ground abstract predictions in familiar anatomical landmarks.
• **Non-Destructive Uncertainty Layers**: Explore the use of confidence intervals and transparent overlays that augment the radiologist's judgment without occluding the source image.
Attendees will leave with a transferrable toolkit for designing cognitive-aware interfaces that reduce mental load and turn AI into a transparent, trusted collaborator.

No medical background required. The domain is the case study; the lessons are broadly applicable in all settings that have both visual and temporal components.

### Tentative flow of the talk

• Introduction
Four universal visualization problems : trust, uncertainty, cognitive load, and AI-human collaboration

• Introduce radiology as an extreme-stakes laboratory for these problems: a brief, visual tour of where the data is the human body and every design decision carries life-or-death consequences.
Designing for Trust in High-Stakes Contexts

• Examine how probability heatmap of AI predictions on a medical scan can trigger either blind trust (automation bias) or reflexive dismissal, and share before/after redesign using transparency controls, confidence indicators, and toggle-able layers that restore viewer agency. This will include design decisions that failed either to build trust or improve speed.

• Representing Uncertainty and Managing Cognitive Load
Demonstrate different visual encodings of the same uncertain data: binary overlays vs. graduated confidence visualizations using color gradients, contour lines, and discrete buckets. 

• Overlaying AI on Human Judgment
AI findings are shown as a hard boundary box (implying false certainty) against a redesigned soft highlight with adjacent confidence scores with a one-click access to underlying reasoning as a part of the redesigned vocabulary for this setup. This will also show how users are given visual controls to interrogate, dismiss or accept AI suggestions on their own terms. 

• Conclusion
Synthesize the four transferable principles into a compact framework


### Target Audience

This talk is for anyone who designs visualizations that inform decisions, regardless of domain. Information designers, visual journalists, data visualization practitioners, UX designers working with data-heavy interfaces, newsroom graphics teams, dashboard and analytics designers, and anyone curious about how high-stakes domains push visualization design forward.

Around 30 million people in Bangladesh live with high blood pressure, but only about 11% have it under control. The rest are at risk of heart attack, stroke, and premature death.

When we started, the biggest challenge was deciding which numbers deserved to be visible. Public health dashboards are also political tools.  They shape what leaders are praised for, what gets funded, and what problems are considered urgent. The numbers at the top of a dashboard become the north star for the system.

In Bangladesh, we worked with the ministry of health and public health experts to create indicator definitions that focused on patient outcomes, but also provided political leverage. As of February 2026, more than 400,000 patients are enrolled in the program. During this period, blood pressure control rates increased from 20% to 60%. 

This talk uses Bangladesh to show how dashboard design influences perception and behaviour at scale.

I’ll focus on three areas:
1. Creating shared vocabulary: Scientists, bureaucrats, and frontline health workers don’t naturally speak the same language of data. We tested and refined metric definitions and dashboard copy with both ministry officials and public health experts until the dashboard told the same story to everyone. Our goal was that a ministry official should be able to interpret and explain the dashboard as confidently as a public health expert.

2. Collecting only essential data: In many facilities, medical officers see 100–200 patients a day. That’s roughly two minutes per patient. Realistically we can't take more than 1/6th of that time for data entry (20s). I’ll share how we decided on the bare minimum data needed to monitor program performance.

3. Making the invisible visible Many important problems in public health stay hidden because of how indicators are defined. A small change in numerator or denominator can completely change what a decision-maker sees. And what’s visible is much harder to ignore. In Bangladesh, we worked with public health scientists to refine definitions that helped us clearly identify:
    - Patients at high risk who needed urgent follow-up
    - Patients likely to return to care if contacted
    - Emerging drug shortages

This talk is for:
* Designers building dashboards for large-scale public programs
* Entrepreneurs working in public systems
* NGOs interested in how the numbers we see shapes behaviour

Attendees will leave with:
* Ideas for how to design dashboards that influence both political decision-making and real-world outcomes
* A practical framework for choosing numerators and denominators that surface real gaps
* Principles for simplifying dashboards to build shared language across bureaucrats, subject experts and tech teams.

7.8 million patients across 7 countries are managed with an almost similar dashboard.

We often document outcomes, but the real story of a project lives in the messy middle- the false starts, the sudden breakthroughs, the detours, and the moments of serendipity. What if we could see those moments more clearly? This session introduces a small part of the Unique Processes, a simple reflective tool that helps translate the invisible phases of a project into something tangible using analogy systems like recipes, films, and journeys.

Outline

We’ve all finished a project that felt like a ""failed dosa"", it looked good on the pan but it refused to come off the pan the moment you started pressing the spatula. But in the professional kitchen, a dish sent back isn't a catastrophe, it’s a data point.

Together, we will try a short 10-minute live exercise where participants take one completed project and map it through an analogy lens of a chef. No drawing skills or preparation needed- just a willingness to reflect and cook.

This talk moves away from ""feeling"" like we did a bad project and toward quantifying the work patterns of our creative and technical selves. We will explore how to treat our personal performance as a dataset, using analogies from the culinary world to map out our strengths, our ""burn rates,"" and our “favourite recipe”. 

We will explore how anomalies like friction points, unexpected shifts, and breakthroughs, can be used as anchors for reflection. Instead of analysing them directly, we translate them into analogies. Was your project like slow cooking a meal? or replicating Reynold Poernomo's dessert recipes. These metaphor frames help reveal what was overdeveloped, what was missing, and where transformation actually happened.

Using analogies helps you treat your mistakes or failures at stepping stones and rungs in a ladder for the next project. 


Requirements

None. Just bring a memory of a project you’ve worked on-  finished, abandoned, or ongoing.

What the Talk is About:
This talk explores Samriddhi, a digital-physical ecosystem designed to formalize credit access for 134+ lakh women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in rural India. It focuses on how data visualization can bridge the ""trust gap"" between formal financial institutions and the ₹30,000 crore unmet credit demand of rural women who lack traditional credit histories.

Core Ideas and Context:
Rural SHGs demonstrate high repayment discipline but remain ""digitally invisible"" to banks due to fragmented, undocumented records. The core idea is the transformation of informal, alternative data—like savings behavior and peer-group participation—into a visual Credit Profile. By creating a ""digital trail of creditworthiness,"" we move from anecdotal trust to data-driven confidence.

Why This Topic Matters:
In regions like Uttar Pradesh, financial exclusion limits the entrepreneurial potential of millions. As a student with a background in Econometrics, I see a profound opportunity to use technical analysis not just for academic study, but as a tool for social equity. Visualizing this data is the final, essential step in making financial inclusion a reality.

Connection to Data Viz Conversations:
This proposal aligns with the ""Visualizations for Community"" theme by addressing inclusivity and human-centric design. It moves the conversation beyond aesthetics to the functional ethics of visualization: how do we design interfaces (like the Samriddhi MFI Dashboard) that represent marginalized individuals accurately and persuasively to institutional gatekeepers?.

Structure and Flow:

1. The Shadow Market: Visualizing the 75% gap where formal credit fails to reach rural women.
2. Building the Bridge: How Samriddhi captures non-traditional indicators and translates them into a cohesive digital ecosystem.
3. The Interface of Trust: A deep dive into the design of the Analytics Dashboard for MFIs, focusing on how risk is visualized through alternative data.
4. Empowerment in View: Demonstrating the impact on loan approval confidence and regional economic growth.

Intended Audience
This talk is for data practitioners, social impact designers, and researchers interested in inclusive design and how visualization can serve the ""last mile"" of community development.

Key Takeaways
1. Visualization as an Equalizer: How to use design to make ""invisible"" communities visible to formal systems

Every research tells a story of patterns, processes, surprises, and discoveries. But too often, those stories stay buried in dense text, cluttered slides, or charts that inform but don’t truly connect. This workshop is an invitation to rethink how we communicate science. Together, we’ll explore how design principles, illustration, data visualization, animation, image editing, and even AI can work hand-in-hand to transform research into visuals that are clear, accurate, and engaging.
Expect hands-on exercises, collaborative doodling, creative interactions, and practical tools you can immediately apply to your own work. Whether you’re a researcher, designer, or science communicator, this session will help you move beyond “just making figures” to crafting visual stories that truly resonate.
Because data deserves more than decoration, it deserves thoughtful design.

Education technology and working with rubrics at scale to select strong fellows for the Teach For India fellowship are my domains of interest.,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyas-vatsa/,Talks,I consent to VizChitra publishing my submission and the review of my application.,TRUE,Visualizations at Work,How Competencies Play Out in Reality — From Applicants to Alumni,"About?
My talk will focus on what the data around the competencies that we evaluate during the selection process is telling us about the applicants and how do we see these play out once they enter the fellowship.

Core ideas? Relevant context?
Rubric design and implementation to evaluate a subjective competency (will take one example to illustrate), why is that competency being evaluated, how do we expect that competency to play out in the fellowship and is the data collected at the selection stage correlating well with what is practically playing out on-ground. I will also provide context about the Teach For India fellowship and selection process for the audience to anchor in.

Why does this topic matter to me?
I head the Selection team at Teach For India and we need to select ~700 fellows each year. This topic is one of immense (and central) professional importance to me and also a topic that I'm curious about (which is one of the reasons I'm in the role!)

Data connect?
As we are evaluating a human being's fit for a fellowship, there is inherent subjectivity. At its core, how do we evaluate them both objectively and in a nuanced manner that acknowledges the human and subjective facets to them? What does the competency data tell us? Also, what does it NOT tell us? How do we evaluate the competencies and is there a scope to improve this from a qualitative and quantitative data lens i.e. are there better/more effective ways of evaluating these competencies?

Audience?
Anyone interested in selecting/hiring/using rubric to evaluate performance and its far-reaching consequences would benefit from attending the talk.

Key takeaways?
1.) What can data practically and accurate inform?
2.) What can data not tell us as that would indicate where we need to avoid making assumptions
3.) Predictability of a selection model — up until what distance from the selection process is the data reliable (and hypotheses for the same)",,,,"Yes, only once",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Small multiples and animated timelines help structure them into a story. Even then, fully loaded maps can be dense and demand effort from readers to see patterns and infer meaning.

With scroll-and-tell maps, you can direct the viewer’s eye and guide attention to what matters. You can pan and zoom into specific locations to shift focus, highlight a region at a time, fade out excess detail and reveal layers step-by-step in sync with text and annotations. Pacing information this way eases cognitive load and creates a sense of journey: along a river, across a city, through time, where readers move through geography and narrative at the same time.

This approach is very useful in narrative building. The technique sits at the intersection of data visualisation, cartography, storytelling, and interface design. While it involves tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript or GIS, deep coding skills are not required to build scroll-based map stories.

In this hands-on workshop, we will use Mapbox as a low-code framework for scrollytelling. Participants will plan, storyboard, and build a story from start to end using a customisable template, a wrapper around technical tools that can be tailored to their own work in the future.

*Who is this workshop for?*
The workshop will benefit data communicators, designers, researchers, journalists, and storytellers who want to create dynamic, interactive, story-driven map experiences that are engaging, memorable, and easy to follow. Prior experience with Flourish, Datawrapper, or QGIS may help but is not necessary.

*How will participants engage? What is the workshop journey?*
In a do-along format, participants will follow a live demo to recreate a scroll-based map story, learning to layer information and choreograph map movements. We will work with an example that incorporates multiple geographic layers, including shapefiles, geojsons, simple csvs with lat-long data, and spatial layers such as land-use and land-cover. Participants will storyboard the narrative in Figma, clean and style layers in QGIS, and export them to Mapbox. Using HTML and JavaScript, we will layer the narrative and bring the map to life, with each step demonstrated live for participants to follow along. 

*What will participants leave with? What will participants be able to do afterward?*
By the end of the workshop, participants will have a working prototype of their first scrolly-map story, a reusable template, and a simple storyboarding framework for future projects. They will learn a practical workflow to craft map-based narratives in their own domains, such as climate, environment, urban development, elections, historical events, where this technique is highly effective.

*What real-world challenge anchors this session?*
Many practitioners face a gap between making maps and telling stories with them. Static visuals or reliance on developer support for interactivity often limit their choices. This workshop provides a practical starting point for participants to create their own interactive, guided map stories.

*Constraints and limitations*
To fit the session timeframe, we will work with small datasets and a pre-designed story template. We will also talk about when scrollytelling is most effective and when it is not, covering challenges such as scroll fatigue, maintaining continuity, and situations where open, exploratory interaction may be more appropriate than a guided narrative.",https://www.mapbox.com/blog/how-to-build-a-scrollytelling-map,https://surbhi-bh.github.io/the-rise-of-gurgaon/,,"Projector, whiteboard, stable internet, power outlets for participants to work on their laptops for a 3-hour hands-on session.",Yes,Keep,Under Review

This talk introduces the concept of an AI-Native Data Compiler — an architectural layer that compiles business intent directly into validated, testable, and reproducible data pipelines that power visualization systems.

Rather than focusing on “AI that generates SQL,” this talk reframes the problem: visualization quality depends on how faithfully business meaning is translated into executable data structures. Today, that translation is manual, iterative, and error-prone.

Drawing from my experience building AI-driven data platforms and schema-driven data exploration systems, I will explore:

* Why current chat-to-SQL and copilot approaches are insufficient for reliable visual systems
* How intent modeling differs from code generation
* The structured reasoning stages of an AI-native compiler:

  * Intent modeling
  * Semantic schema mapping
  * Transformation synthesis
  * Validation and edge-case generation
  * Deterministic pipeline emission
* How compiled transformations can produce visualization-ready, self-describing data contracts

A key idea in this talk is that visualization systems should not depend on fragile, undocumented pipelines. Instead, they should consume compiled, validated transformation artifacts that embed rounding rules, null strategies, aggregation logic, and reproducibility constraints.

The structure of the talk:

1. The hidden fragility behind modern dashboards
2. Why visualization accuracy is a compilation problem
3. The AI-Native Data Compiler architecture
4. Schema-driven data exploration and visualization generation
5. Implications for the future of autonomous visual analytics

This topic matters to me because I have spent years building data infrastructure where visualization correctness depends on subtle transformation logic. Repeatedly, I’ve observed that visualization errors are rarely visual — they originate upstream in translation failures.

For the data visualization community, this proposal connects directly to ongoing conversations around trust, reproducibility, explainability, and human-AI collaboration in visual systems.

The intended audience includes visualization practitioners, data engineers, analytics leads, and researchers exploring AI-assisted visual analytics.

Key takeaways:

* Visualization systems are only as reliable as their transformation semantics
* AI must move from assistive code generation to structured compilation
* Schema-aware reasoning enables reproducible visual data contracts
* The future of data visualization is tightly coupled with AI-native data infrastructure",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-ai-native-data-compiler-varadharajan-srinivasan-j0hec/,,,"Yes, many times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

Are we settling for a ""Universal Palette"" that is actually a cultural misfit? What if the answer to this question, one that truly aligns with the Indian mind, is hidden in a 3,000-year-old Vedic logic that treats anything invisible as a vibration? And what if we could visualize this vibration in a way that is beautiful to the modern eye? Taking inspiration from these questions, we won’t just look at a data visual; we will bloom a Mandala together, turning individual vibrations into a shared ""Ring of Life."" What I like to call: The Navarasa Mandala.

The Outline:

The Gap: Most current UI/UX frameworks are “universal” in name but rooted in Western assumptions. We will explore how perception of color and emotion varies across cultures and ages, and why inherited Newtonian models fail to capture the vibrational subtleties of human experience. This sets the stage for rethinking data visualization through an Indian philosophical lens.

The How: To design for the cultural mind, we begin with something we already know: Navarasa (9), the emotional essences that shape how we experience and express life. We then explore how emotion is filtered through frequency, energy, and color, expressed as Sapta Varna (7). Finally, we identify how all of this remains fundamentally connected to the Pancha Bhutas (5), the elemental forces that ground energy into form. This integrated lens is what I coin as the 9-7-5 framework, Vac Shakthi.

The Experience: The talk culminates in an interactive performance, where the audience co-creates a live, blooming Mandala, a visual symphony of the 9-7-5 framework. By interacting with the Vac-Shakthi interface, participants’ inputs, the essence of emotion (9), the energy perceived (7), and the elemental grounding (5), cause the Mandala to grow and evolve. This transforms a blank canvas into a shared, immersive visualization, allowing us to collectively see “what the room is feeling.”

Why listen to me?
I am attempting something audacious: re-examining Bharata Muni’s 2,000-year-old emotion–color correspondences not through debate, but through experimentation.
Through study of texts such as the Rigveda and the Natya Shastra, I identified subtle conceptual patterns linking vibration, light, and elemental grounding. These insights enabled me to map Navarasa, Sapta Varna, and Pancha Bhuta as an interconnected system, one that mirrors the classical understanding of creation of life.
This research, combined with technical implementation, uniquely positions me to present and test this framework through live interaction.

Audience Takeaway: 
- Recognize that the idea of a culturally neutral “Universal Palette” is a construct, and question whether emotional perception is context-dependent.
- Understand the relationship between emotion, perception, and elemental structure as a connected system, open to further development through continued research.
- Learn how a Mandala can function as a visual method to read group emotion and identify alignment between individuals.
- Examine whether an ancient aesthetic framework maps onto contemporary consciousness.
The Takeaway: Audience will leave seeing themselves as a finely tuned instrument: 5 strings plucked by 7 frequencies to produce the 9 melodies of the human experience.

> ... comprehension is compression. You compress things into computer programs.
> The simpler the theory, the better you understand something.

While Chaitin was talking about the communication of scientific facts and
axioms, it is not hard to see parallels to this in visual analytics. E.g.,
anyone who practices data analytics eventually concludes that a dashboard, to be
effective, must compress data. A chart must be _simpler_ than the
data it explains. And the insight drawn from the chart must in turn be simpler
than the chart itself. This leads to a chain of lossy compressions from data to
charts to insights (or captions of the charts).

But, can we automate this compression chain? Given a dataset, could we train a
machine to automatically render the right visual and derive from it precisely
the right insight?

This talk stems from a series of experiments around answering these very
questions. At one level, we know the answer to be a resounding ""yes"", because of
LLMs. No less than S Anand himself has enthusiastically (and effectively)
advocated the automation of visual analytics with LLMs. GenAI can clearly build
the aforementioned lossy compression pipeline from data to insights. But as
Anand himself admits (in a proposal for a dialogue in this very edition of
VizChitra), the real problem is not of creation, but _curation_. So the question
now is not whether we can automate the compression of data into charts and
charts into insights, but whether we can do so while avoiding _slop_.

My core hypothesis is that the three interlinked elements of a chart,

1. the visual, or the raw pixels of the chart,
2. the declarative specification of the chart (in a language like, say, Vega),
and
3. the set of insight(s) drawn from it (or the captions one could write for it),

are all one and the same thing. I call them the chart triplet. It's reasonable
that if a skilled analyst has only one of the above, they could come up with
decent approximations of the other two.

In the talk, I will

* Test this hypothesis: see whether it is possible to train a machine to be a
  skilled analyst who can navigate from any one of these three aspects of a
  chart to the other two.
* Build a dense, unified representation (or embedding) of the chart triplet is
  possible and meaningful.
* Find out whether the representation is able to generate charts and insights
  that are useful enough to be _consumed_ (in other words, whether it solves the
  aforementioned _curation_ problem).
* Show how visual + language transformer models can be trained to identify if
  captions and insights are big, useful and surprising.

Before the talk, I will be realeasing an open dataset containing over 1,50,000
individual charts, each with its Vega spec in JSON,
accompanied with a million captions. All code, trained models and documentation
will also be released. The audience are welcome to use these
assets to benchmark their own storytelling processes.",,,,"Yes, many times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

With a prerequisite of learning to use data tools to begin; the tools create an entry barrier for non-technical users. Once you have this skill, as a data analyst, you spend weeks effort, building dashboard by going through individual data column before you can even glimpse your your data

Now, even if you built the most perfect dashboard, they fail because executives lack the time to interpret charts, and business users avoid cognitively overwhelming interfaces, relying on analysts for weekly digging, pattern matching, and storytelling. This reliance persists because current tools don't invite or enable easy data exploration.

Most data visualisation tools today are built like Photoshop, very powerful, but demanding tool expertise and a lot of cognitive effort in comprehending the data. What if we designed these products differently to solve the last mile of data access? What would be the product principles required to create the BI equivalent of Canva and how does it translate to UX?

Today, AI should handle mundane tasks. For creators, this means automating artifact creation and repeatable data analysis. For consumers, it means delivering insights in engaging formats to bridge the interpretation gap.

However, integrating generative, probabilistic AI into a complex, accuracy-dependent tool is challenging. Its unpredictability makes it less trustworthy. Creators need deterministic outputs, and enterprise users demand trusted data for critical decisions, yet also need engaging data interaction. How can we balance automation and human control? Can existing simplicity principles suffice, or are new guidelines necessary?

Outline
Business dashboards are often boring and hard to use, making insights difficult to grasp. We will start by engaging the audience with a problem identification exercise to tailor the talk and segue into how current BI tools fail both consumers and data analysts.

We will then establish the product principles used in existing BI tools and share our process for developing unique principles that yield a different user experience, showcased through UI examples and system integration.

Next, we will challenge these principles with emerging AI technology. We'll set the context for AI's benefits in business analytics, discuss industry challenges, and examine which product principles remain valid and which need amendment in the age of AI.

We will conclude by addressing the open-ended design questions the industry faces regarding a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

This talk looks at something we all see but rarely connect: the rush toward a few big cities for work, and the quiet emptiness that grows in the towns left behind. Every year, millions move to metros chasing opportunity. We debate traffic, rent, pollution, and infrastructure stress. But we don’t often visualize what happens in the districts people leave, especially to ageing parents who stay back.

At its heart, this talk argues that India has not urbanized too much, it has urbanized too narrowly. A disproportionate share of formal jobs is concentrated in a handful of cities. That concentration pulls young workers in, strains infrastructure at the destination, and gradually reshapes family structures at the origin. Using migration data, employment distribution figures, and datasets on elderly living arrangements, I connect these patterns into one coherent story.

This topic is personal. My own family migrated to another state in search of better opportunities. In doing so, we left behind paternal land and extended family. The move opened doors, but it also created distance. That experience made me curious about how widespread this pattern is, and what it means at scale. Data gives us a way to step back from individual stories and see the structural forces beneath them.

In the context of data visualization, this talk contributes to conversations around narrative design and systems thinking. Rather than presenting a dashboard full of filters, I structure the presentation as a visual essay. The sequence matters. Each section builds on the previous one to reveal a relationship, not just a statistic. The goal is not to overwhelm with charts, but to guide interpretation carefully.

The presentation unfolds in five parts. First, a migration flow map establishes where people are moving and how concentrated those flows are. Second, employment distribution visuals show how job creation clusters in major metros. Third, district-level ageing data reveals where elderly populations are growing and how many are living alone or only with a spouse. Fourth, infrastructure indicators illustrate the pressure building in destination cities. Finally, a modeled scenario explores what might change if job growth were distributed more intentionally across Tier-2 cities.

This talk is intended for data visualization practitioners, policymakers, urban researchers, and students interested in how data can shape public understanding.

The key takeaway is simple: migration itself is not the problem. Uneven opportunity is. And when we visualize systems instead of isolated numbers, we begin to see both the economic engine of cities and the social cost unfolding quietly elsewhere.

What began as a way to practice making gradually became a way to understand how I think, how I change, and how patterns emerge over time.

Through more than 3,600 daily works created under consistent constraints, the practice has helped me notice recurring decisions, habits, and visual tendencies that are difficult to see in short term projects. Over time, repetition revealed where I take shortcuts, where I linger, when I experiment, and when I retreat to familiar forms.

Rather than treating each piece as an isolated outcome, this talk looks at the practice as a whole, as a living archive and a longitudinal record of decision making. Shifts in tools, energy, confidence, and attention are visible across years. Periods of intensity, doubt, change, and stability are reflected not through explicit data, but through form, color, complexity, and rhythm.

This practice matters deeply to me because it became a way to externalize my internal process. It allowed me to see my own patterns with distance and compassion, and to understand how creative work can act as a journal that records not just what we make, but who we are at different moments in our lives.

The talk connects these reflections to broader conversations in data visualization and visual craft. It asks what we gain when we treat long term practice as a form of data, and what becomes visible when time itself is the organizing structure. Instead of metrics or dashboards, the signal emerges through accumulation, consistency, and change.

Structured as a narrative walkthrough, the presentation moves between personal reflection and pattern recognition, showing how sustained making can surface insight without quantification. The intended audience includes designers, artists, data visualization practitioners, and educators interested in process, craft, and reflective practice.

- What this talk is about
We share an ongoing collaboration between IIHS and the Rajasthan Mahila Kaamgaar Union (RMKU), a 15-year-old union of domestic and informal women workers in Rajasthan. RMKU has painstakingly documented thousands of workers, including a cross-section survey of 10,000 domestic workers, yet much of this data remains inaccessible because of weak protocols for sharing insights and limited skills to read and question it.
To address this, we tried two new ways of communicating data back to the union. We use a fictional composite character, Rani, a domestic worker facing low and delayed wages, debt, housing insecurity, child illness, and constant fear of job loss, as an entry point into the dataset. We follow her story and then slowly zoom out to show how patterns of age, migration, tenure in the city, and union reach appear in aggregate data on 10,000+ women across Jaipur’s nine Assembly constituencies and 42 meeting areas, while also familiarising readers with standard charts and gradually building basic data literacy.

-Why this matters for the VizChitra community
Three linked problems sit at the heart of this work:
1.	The invisibility of grassroots data
Even with rich data, RMKU has rarely treated it as evidence in policy conversations or media narratives about cities and labour. Even within the union, this data has not always translated into everyday organising decisions.
2.	Chart inaccessibility and fear of technical visuals.
Organisers and members are deeply familiar with the lives behind the numbers, but charts and maps often feel intimidating, or disconnected from experience. This creates a paradox: the people closest to the data are the least able to use the tools that claim to represent them.
3.	Aggregates without people
Visualisations of the city often start from bird’s-eye views in terms of aggregates, and only later lead to the worker. In our work, we reverse this order: we begin with a story like Rani’s and then reveal how many others share her plight.
For the VizChitra community, this talk offers a grounded case of what it means to reclaim data and data insights created with people as a public good, and to design visual narratives that remain accessible to the people whose lives they summarise. 

-Who is the audience for this session
This session is for people who work with data on people’s lives and want it to matter to the communities it describes. It targets researcher–practitioners, including students, journalists, civic-tech designers, organisers in unions/NGOs/collectives, and educators who want to turn datasets into clear, accessible stories that support organising and decision-making.

-Takeaway for participants
Participants can expect three broad takeaways from this session:
1.	A grounded sense of how a worker-led union like RMKU uses its own data for day-to-day administration, planning, and monitoring, to spot key patterns and turn them into organising questions and decisions.
2.	This can also be considered as a repeatable template for others who like to replicate the data work at grassroots level for decision making and making data more accessible to the real users.
3.	Practical ideas, tailored to their own contexts, for moving from treating data as a closed expert asset to treating it as a public good that communities can read, question, and act on together.

-Summating idea
For us, RMKU is not a one-off case but a proof of concept for a way of seeing, from person to pattern and back, that can travel to other unions and movements wherever data awaits reclaiming as a public good.",https://www.iied.org/covid-relief-archive-for-lessons-urban-social-protection-corals#jaipur,,,"Yes, many times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

The issue is heat distress experienced by children in school environments. The talk will describe how we designed a participatory game to help adults understand what children experience during periods of high heat stress. The game was developed as part of a larger project called Heat Futures at 78° E which brought together a multidisciplinary cohort to reimagine culture, systems and everyday practice in a fast-heating world.

The core idea of the talk is that data does not always speak for itself. Some problems remain hidden because adults are far removed from the sites where they occur. Classrooms are one such site. Children experience heat differently from adults. Their discomfort is often normalised or dismissed. Therefore, the primary function of the game was to bring adults into the space of the classroom and offer a glimpse of children’s experience of school on hot days.

The game asks participants to inhabit the role of different children through personas. Each persona reflects a different set of conditions such as age, physiological vulnerabilities, and socio-psychological characteristics. As heat stress builds in the classroom, participants are required to address subjective heat distress with evidence-based interventions that schools can adopt. These include changes in ventilation, scheduling, rules, hydration, and classroom design.

We feel this is a crucial topic to address because we rarely think of climatic impacts from children’s perspective. Although heat is becoming a daily reality for many children, it remains weakly addressed in school planning and policy. Thermal comfort indices rely on adult (often male) bodies and rarely captures how heat is felt by children in classrooms. The project, therefore, is an attempt to show how data can be experienced rather than just seen and how the format of a game allows data to travel across disciplines and audiences.

The talk will be structured in four parts. First, I will introduce the problem of heat in school environments. Second, I will describe the data and research that informed the game. Third, I will walk through the game design and how personas and interventions were integrated into the game to make a compelling case for heat adaptation in schools. Finally, I will reflect on what this approach offers to community focused data work.

I will also highlight the process of building the game through a multidisciplinary team. The team included a visual designer, game designer, illustrator, educator, architect, and researcher. I will share how different forms of expertise shaped the final outcome. This includes tensions, translations, and learning across disciplines.

The intended audience includes data practitioners, designers, educators, and community researchers. The key takeaway is that data for community work can benefit from play, collaboration, and attention to lived experience. ",,,,"Yes, only once",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review

When it sits on servers and dashboards no one visits? Or when it is buried in lengthy reports that few have time to read? Within the data value chain, data only gains value when it is used.

In this talk, I share practical insights from my work with National Statistical Offices (NSOs) across Asia and the Pacific. Traditionally, NSOs have focused on producing and disseminating data. Uptake and impact are assumed to follow. In practice, they rarely do.

To bridge this gap, I ask government officials a simple question: “What’s in your bag?” Participants then pull everyday objects from their bags (e.g., currency notes, house keys, even an umbrella!) to construct data stories. This physicalization exercise reveals something fundamental: data does not travel on its own. Meaning is constructed, interpreted, and communicated. Everyone in the system plays a role in shaping whether evidence reaches decision-making spaces.

Through this unconventional but deliberate method, I explore how data communication can shift mindsets, build institutional appetite for evidence, and strengthen the link between data production and policy action.

This talk will resonate with data communication practitioners, researchers, policymakers, civil society actors, and community advocates interested in moving from data availability to data use. Participants will leave with practical insights into how national statistical systems operate, the barriers that limit uptake, and opportunities to promote better data uses within government institutions.

Complex data can often feel either too overwhelming or too simplified if not backed with the right design, treatment, and most importantly, the right visual tone.

As graphic designers working with data for both commercial and personal projects, we’ve often found ourselves navigating the line between story and accuracy. 

When does storytelling help make data more human, and when does it start taking something away? 
Why do some visual choices feel instinctively “right” while others, though technically sound, seem slightly off? 
What gets lost when we simplify or dramatise a story?

Through this talk, I’d like to share some examples of our work along with a peek into our process where both form and function strike a good balance. From topics like climate change, healthcare, commercial travel, and cinema to more personal explorations where we turn everyday experiences into data stories.

Beyond a showcase, the talk will offer a peek behind the process: moments where we’ve had to compromise on aesthetics for accuracy, or tone down narrative to keep nuance intact. 

Who is it for: 
Designers, researchers, and early-career practitioners who work with or communicate data, and often find themselves wondering how far to go with storytelling.

What participants will take away:
* Ways to decide when narrative helps vs when it distorts
* Visual metaphors that make complex data easier to grasp
* Design moves that unintentionally shift meaning or lose nuance
* Simple frameworks to balance clarity, empathy, and honesty ",studiopingpong.com/project/booking-com,owomaniya.studiopingpong.com,yearinreview.studiopingpong.com,I have never given a talk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keep,Under Review
