<Card variant="bordered" color="pink" title="Visualizations for Community">

How can data visualization support communities, public interest work, and social change?

- Make socio-economic data more accessible in public conversations, or engage marginalized groups through participatory approaches
- Support nonprofits, NGOs, civic-tech groups, advocacy organizations, environmental justice initiatives, or public interest journalism
- Practice ethical and inclusive data visualization, including accessibility, representation and cultural sensitivity

</Card>

<Card variant="bordered" color="blue" title="Visualizations as Craft">

How do you design, refine, and craft a visualization from first sketch to final story?

- Explore visual design principles: color, layout, typography in data visualization
- Shape storytelling and narrative design for data-informed stories
- Design interactions for dashboards, exploratory tools, and interactive stories
- Share critiques, reflections, and case studies on what makes visualizations effective, confusing, or misleading

</Card>

<Card variant="bordered" color="teal" title="Visualizations at Work">

How does visualization work inside your domains to inform real-world decisions and practice?

- Showcase industrial applications where visualization played a central role in decision-making workflows, or working with sensitive data under regulatory constraints
- Share case studies where data was communicated with domain experts, stakeholders, or business leaders through visualizations

</Card>

<Card variant="bordered" color="yellow" title="Visualizations and Tools">

What tools, systems, and workflows power the visualizations we create and use?

- Author tools, libraries, frameworks, and platforms for creating data visualizations
- Build systems for scalable data exploration, analysis, and interaction
- Design pipelines, workflows, and integrations that bring visualization into existing data, design, or product processes
- Create collaborative and conversational interfaces for working with data (including AI-augmented tools)

## How to shape your proposal

Use these prompts as a mini-outline while drafting your submission.

1. **Who is the audience for your session?** -- Think about their backgrounds, roles, and questions. Are they students, early-career practitioners, domain experts, or cross-disciplinary collaborators?

2. **What problem or question are you centering?** -- Describe the pain point, curiosity, or gap you want to address. This helps participants understand why your session matters.

3. **What is the scope of your session?** -- Outline the main ideas, themes, or steps you plan to cover. It is okay if your work is still evolving – give us a clear sense of direction.

4. **What will participants take away?** -- Share the practical outcomes: skills, mental models, checklists, workflows, or new ways of seeing a familiar problem.

5. **Which format best supports your aims?** -- Consider whether your idea works best as a talk, group discussion, or hands-on workshop.

<Notice color="yellow">

**What makes a strong VizChitra session?**

The most successful sessions tend to:

- Start from real, lived challenges or questions.
- Make the process visible, not just the polished final chart.
- Offer concrete, reusable insights or tools.
- Create room for reflection, conversation, or play.
