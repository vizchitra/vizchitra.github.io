## How to shape your proposal

Use these prompts as a mini-outline while drafting your submission.

1. **Who is the audience for your session?** -- Think about their backgrounds, roles, and questions. Are they students, early-career practitioners, domain experts, or cross-disciplinary collaborators?

2. **What problem or question are you centering?** -- Describe the pain point, curiosity, or gap you want to address. This helps participants understand why your session matters.

3. **What is the scope of your session?** -- Outline the main ideas, themes, or steps you plan to cover. It is okay if your work is still evolving – give us a clear sense of direction.

4. **What will participants take away?** -- Share the practical outcomes: skills, mental models, checklists, workflows, or new ways of seeing a familiar problem.

5. **Which format best supports your aims?** – Consider whether your idea works best as a talk, group discussion, or hands-on workshop.

### What makes a strong VizChitra session?

The most successful sessions tend to:

- Start from real, lived challenges or questions.
- Make the process visible, not just the polished final chart.
- Offer concrete, reusable insights or tools.
- Create room for reflection, conversation, or play.
