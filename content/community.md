At VizChitra, we’re not just creating data stories; we’re building a culture of data storytelling and literacy in India – one that is collaborative, nuanced, and joyfully human.

We have more than 1,800 people in the community, which we refer to as **Friends of VizChitra**. The primary mode of conversation is through _The VizChitra Community Group_ on WhatsApp. You can join them on WhatsApp at [https://vizchitra.com/friends](https://vizchitra.com/friends)
