<Slanted tag="h2" color="pink" textContent="THE DO'S AND DONT'S FOR THE COMMUNITY" />

This code of conduct applies across online exchanges, conferences and other events hosted by VizChitra community.

We are here as a community to deliberate on the topics of the community.

- Be nice to everyone,
- Be empathetic,
- Be questioning, as it furthers the discussion, but
- Discuss ideas, not people and their personalities (as that would be ad hominem).

### Prohibited Behavior

We strongly condemn any kind of harassment of any fellow participant. This includes:

- Sustained disruption of talks, discussions and other events.
- Offensive remarks or jokes made about women, men, persons of non-binary genders and those with physical disabilities, or on the basis of sexuality, race, caste or religion.
- Use of images that objectify the human body unless absolutely relevant to the discussion.
- Inappropriate physical contact and invasion of private space.
- Deliberate intimidation, unwelcome gestures and stalking.
